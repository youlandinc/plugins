# NightVision API Discovery

Use this skill when helping users generate OpenAPI specifications from their source code using `nightvision swagger extract`. API Discovery performs static analysis — no running application or compilation needed — and annotates the spec with source file paths and line numbers (Code Traceback) so that vulnerabilities found during DAST scans trace back to exact code locations.

## Agent workflow

When a user asks to extract or document their API:

1. **Check prerequisites** — verify the NightVision CLI is available (`nightvision --help`)
2. **Examine the repo** — identify the backend language and web framework to determine the `--lang` flag and whether the framework is supported (see [references/framework-support.md](references/framework-support.md))
3. **Run extraction** — execute `nightvision swagger extract` with the appropriate flags. On success, the CLI prints `"Swagger file extracted successfully."` and writes the spec to the output path (default: `openapi-spec.yml`)
4. **Review the output** — read the generated spec to check completeness. Handle unresolved variables if `nv.config` was created alongside the spec
5. **Compare coverage** — if the user has an existing spec, run `nightvision swagger diff` to show what was discovered vs. what was documented
6. **Upload to target** — attach the spec to a NightVision target for scanning

**Related skills:** Use `scan-configuration` for target/auth setup, `ci-cd-integration` for pipeline integration, `scan-triage` for interpreting scan results.

## Language flags

| Language | Flag | Frameworks |
|----------|------|------------|
| Python | `--lang python` | Django, DRF, Flask, Flask-RESTful, FastAPI |
| Java | `--lang java` | Spring Boot, JAX-RS/Jersey, Micronaut, Java EE/Jakarta EE |
| JavaScript | `--lang js` | Express, NestJS, Fastify |
| C# | `--lang dotnet` | ASP.NET Core (controllers, minimal APIs) |
| Go | `--lang go` | Gin, httprouter, net/http (experimental) |
| Ruby | `--lang ruby` | Rails, Grape |

See [references/framework-support.md](references/framework-support.md) for detailed component coverage per framework.

## Running extraction

```bash
# Basic extraction (output defaults to openapi-spec.yml)
nightvision swagger extract . --lang python

# Specify output file and format
nightvision swagger extract . --lang java -o api-spec.json --file-format json

# Extract and upload directly to a NightVision target
nightvision swagger extract . -t my-api -p my-project --lang python

# Extract without uploading
nightvision swagger extract . -o openapi-spec.yml --lang java --no-upload

# Scan multiple source directories
nightvision swagger extract ./service-a ./service-b --lang python

# Extend an existing spec (add discovered endpoints to it)
nightvision swagger extract . --lang python --extend existing-spec.yml

# Exclude directories from analysis
nightvision swagger extract . --lang python --exclude vendor,generated

# Include code snippets in the spec (useful for debugging)
nightvision swagger extract . --lang python --dump-code
```

### Extraction fallback for CI

Extraction can fail if language detection fails or the framework isn't supported. Always guard against this in pipelines:

```bash
nightvision swagger extract . -t $TARGET --lang java || true
if [ ! -e openapi-spec.yml ]; then cp backup-openapi-spec.yml openapi-spec.yml; fi
```

## Handling unresolved variables

When static analysis can't resolve a variable (e.g., an API prefix read from an environment variable), it appears as a literal placeholder in the spec. NightVision generates an `nv.config` file to fix this.

**Steps:**
1. Run extraction — if unresolved variables exist, `nv.config` is created alongside the spec (in the first source directory passed to the command)
2. Open `nv.config` — find the `replacements` object with `null` values
3. Replace `null` with the actual values (check the app's config files, environment vars, etc.)
4. Re-run extraction — the tool reads `nv.config` and substitutes the values. You can also use `-c` / `--config` to explicitly specify the config file path: `nightvision swagger extract . --lang python -c path/to/nv.config`

```json
// nv.config example
{
  "replacements": {
    "Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.WebApplication.Services...ApiPrefix": null
  }
}
```

The agent should help the user find the actual value by searching their config files (`appsettings.json`, `.env`, `settings.py`, etc.) and updating `nv.config`.

## Comparing API specs

Use `swagger diff` to measure coverage or detect breaking changes:

```bash
# Summary diff (paths and schemas counts)
nightvision swagger diff original-spec.yml discovered-spec.yml

# Show only path-level changes (endpoints added/removed/modified)
nightvision swagger diff original-spec.yml discovered-spec.yml --paths

# Show only schema changes
nightvision swagger diff original-spec.yml discovered-spec.yml --schemas

# Show the full diff (paths and schemas together, with details)
nightvision swagger diff original-spec.yml discovered-spec.yml --full-diff

# Save diff output to file
nightvision swagger diff original-spec.yml discovered-spec.yml -o diff-report.txt
```

Common use cases:
- **Coverage analysis** — compare a hand-written spec against the discovered one to find undocumented shadow APIs
- **PR checks** — diff specs from the base branch vs. PR branch to detect breaking API changes
- **Audit** — verify that all endpoints are documented

## Detecting existing specs

Search the codebase for existing OpenAPI/Swagger files. The `detect` command takes no positional arguments — use `-p` to specify the root folder:

```bash
# Detect project roots in the current directory
nightvision swagger detect

# Detect in a specific directory
nightvision swagger detect -p ./path/to/code

# Save detection results as JSON
nightvision swagger detect -o detection-results.json
```

## Code Traceback

The generated spec includes `x-source` annotations on each endpoint with the file path and line number where the route is declared. When this spec is used for DAST scanning:

- Vulnerabilities found by NightVision link directly to the source code
- GitHub Security Alerts, Azure Boards work items, and Jenkins Warnings show the exact file and line
- Developers see where to fix, not just what to fix

This is why using NightVision-generated specs (vs. hand-written ones) significantly improves the triage experience.

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| No endpoints found | Wrong `--lang` flag, or unsupported framework | Verify the framework is supported, check `--lang` value |
| Unresolved variables in paths | Config values read from env vars without defaults | Fill in `nv.config` replacements and re-run |
| Incomplete routes | Custom routing, non-standard framework usage | NightVision relies on standard framework patterns; custom routing may not be detected |
| Extraction fails entirely | Syntax errors in source, missing files | Use `--diagnostics` to get language-level error details |
| Spec missing sub-routes | Code in subdirectories not scanned | Pass multiple paths: `nightvision swagger extract ./src ./lib` |
