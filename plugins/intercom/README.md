## Access & Limitations

- **Safe, read-only access** — The plugin can search and retrieve data but cannot create, update, or delete conversations, contacts, or other Intercom objects. Your workspace data is never modified.
- **US region only** — Currently supports US-hosted Intercom workspaces. EU and Australia region support is planned.
- **Rate limits** — Search operations are subject to Intercom API rate limits. The MCP server handles throttling automatically.
