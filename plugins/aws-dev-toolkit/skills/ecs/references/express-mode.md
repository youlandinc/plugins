# Amazon ECS Express Mode — Detailed Reference

ECS Express Mode provisions a complete production application stack from a single API call requiring only three parameters: a container image, task execution role, and infrastructure role. No additional charge beyond the underlying AWS resources. AWS recommends Express Mode as the migration path from App Runner (closing to new customers April 30, 2026).

## Pros

- **3-parameter deployment** — Container image, execution role, infrastructure role. Everything else gets sensible defaults.
- **Production-ready from day one** — Canary deployments, AZ rebalancing, auto-scaling (CPU/memory/request count), health checks, HTTPS with auto-provisioned ACM certificate, CloudWatch logging — all configured automatically.
- **Full ECS underneath** — All underlying resources (service, task definition, ALB, security groups, scaling policies) are created in your account and remain directly accessible. Customize any resource after creation without leaving Express Mode.
- **ALB sharing across services** — Up to 25 Express Mode services in the same VPC share an ALB via host-header routing, significantly reducing per-service cost. Express Mode auto-provisions and deprovisions ALBs as services are added/removed.
- **Cluster sharing** — Express Mode services can coexist in the same cluster with standard ECS services.
- **IaC support** — Available via Console, CLI, SDKs, CloudFormation, Terraform, and the AWS Labs MCP Server for ECS.
- **No vendor lock-in risk** — Unlike App Runner, Express Mode is just ECS. "Eject" to standard ECS management at any time by managing the underlying resources directly.

## Cons / Limitations

- **HTTP/HTTPS workloads only** — Express Mode provisions an ALB and expects HTTP traffic. Not suitable for TCP/UDP services (use NLB + standard ECS), queue workers, batch jobs, gRPC without HTTP/2, or non-web workloads.
- **Fargate only** — No EC2 launch type. Rules out GPU instances, Graviton selection, host-level access, Docker-in-Docker, EBS volume mounts, or custom AMIs.
- **Canary deployment locked** — Deployment strategy is set to Canary and cannot be changed after creation. No rolling update or Blue/Green (CodeDeploy) option.
- **Load balancer config immutable** — Load balancer configurations cannot be updated on Express Mode services. If NLB, custom listener rules, or multi-protocol support is needed, use standard ECS.
- **Service name and cluster immutable after create** — Cannot be changed on updates.
- **Subnet lock-in per VPC** — The first Express Mode service in a VPC defines the subnets for that VPC's shared ALB (internet-facing or internal). Subsequent services must match those AZs.
- **Single container only** — No sidecar support in the Express Mode API. Envoy proxies, log routers, or datadog agents as sidecars require editing the task definition directly after creation.
- **Default VPC requirements** — If no subnets are specified, requires a default VPC with at least two public subnets in two AZs with at least 8 free IPs per CIDR block per subnet.
- **x86_64 Linux only by default** — Defaults to X86_64 architecture on Linux. ARM/Graviton requires post-creation task definition changes.
- **Container name sensitivity** — The default container is named "Main". Renaming it can break Express Mode's ability to manage subsequent updates via the Express Mode Console or APIs.

## Defaults Table

All underlying resources remain accessible for direct management.

| Resource | Default | Customizable via Express Mode? |
|----------|---------|-------------------------------|
| Launch type | Fargate capacity provider | No |
| Task CPU/Memory | 1 vCPU / 2 GB | Yes (`--cpu`, `--memory`) |
| Deployment strategy | Canary | No (locked) |
| AZ rebalancing | Enabled | No (editable on service directly) |
| Auto-scaling metric | CPU at 60% target | Yes (`--scaling-target`) |
| Min/Max tasks | 1 / 20 | Yes (`--scaling-target`) |
| Health check grace | 300s | No (editable on service directly) |
| Container port | 80 | Yes (`--primary-container`) |
| Health check path | `/` | Yes (`--health-check-path`) |
| Logging | CloudWatch Logs, non-blocking, 25MB buffer | Yes (log group, prefix) |
| Subnets | Default VPC public subnets | Yes (`--network-configuration`) |
| ALB scheme | Internet-facing (public) or Internal (private) | Based on subnet type |

## Resources Created by Express Mode

Express Mode automatically provisions and configures:

- ECS default cluster (if not already existing) with Fargate capacity providers
- Task definition with container, logging, and networking configurations
- Service with canary deployment and auto-scaling
- Application Load Balancer with HTTPS listener, listener rules, and target groups
- Security groups with minimal required ingress (service SG + LB SG)
- Service Linked Roles for auto-scaling and load balancing
- Application Auto Scaling scalable target and target tracking scaling policy
- CloudWatch Log group specific to the service
- Metric alarm for detecting faulty deployments
- ACM certificate for HTTPS

## Resource Sharing and Cost Optimization

- **Load balancer sharing** — Up to 25 Express Mode services in the same VPC share an ALB. Express Mode auto-provisions additional ALBs as needed and deprovisions unused ones as services are removed.
- **Cluster sharing** — Express Mode services can be grouped in ECS Clusters alongside standard (non-Express) ECS services.

## IAM Roles

| Role | Required? | Purpose |
|------|-----------|---------|
| `ecsTaskExecutionRole` | Yes | Pull images from ECR, send logs to CloudWatch, retrieve secrets |
| `ecsInfrastructureRoleForExpressServices` | Yes | Manage AWS resources (ALB, SGs, scaling) on your behalf |
| Task Role (`--task-role-arn`) | Optional | Allow application code to call other AWS services (S3, DynamoDB, etc.) |

Auto-created service-linked roles: `ecsServiceRoleForECS`, `AWSServiceRoleForElasticLoadBalancing`, `AWSServiceRoleForApplicationAutoScaling_ECSService`.

## CLI Commands

```bash
# Create an Express Mode service (minimal — 3 required params)
aws ecs create-express-gateway-service \
  --execution-role-arn arn:aws:iam::role/ecsTaskExecutionRole \
  --infrastructure-role-arn arn:aws:iam::role/ecsInfrastructureRoleForExpressServices \
  --primary-container 'image=nginx'

# Create with custom scaling, port, and service name
aws ecs create-express-gateway-service \
  --execution-role-arn arn:aws:iam::role/ecsTaskExecutionRole \
  --infrastructure-role-arn arn:aws:iam::role/ecsInfrastructureRoleForExpressServices \
  --primary-container 'image=my-app:v1,port=8080' \
  --scaling-target '{"minTaskCount": 2}' \
  --service-name my-api

# Monitor an Express Mode deployment (interactive terminal UI)
aws ecs monitor-express-gateway-service \
  --service-arn arn:aws:ecs:us-east-1:123456789012:service/my-cluster/my-svc

# Monitor with custom timeout (default 30 min)
aws ecs monitor-express-gateway-service \
  --service-arn my-express-gateway-service \
  --timeout 60

# Delete an Express Mode service and its managed resources
aws ecs delete-express-gateway-service --service <service-name-or-arn>
```

## When to Use Express Mode vs Standard ECS

| TCP/UDP services | No | Yes (NLB) |
| Queue workers / batch jobs | No | Yes |
| GPU workloads | No | Yes (EC2 launch type) |
| Graviton / ARM | No (x86 default, manual change) | Yes |

| Sidecar containers | No (manual post-creation) | Yes |
| NLB or custom LB config | No | Yes |
| Service-to-service (non-HTTP) | No | Yes (Service Connect, NLB) |
