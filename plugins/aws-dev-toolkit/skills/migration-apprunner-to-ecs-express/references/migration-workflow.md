# Migration Workflow: App Runner to ECS Express Mode

At each step, use the `awsknowledge` MCP tools to look up current API syntax and the `ecs-mcp` MCP to inspect live infrastructure. Supplement with web search for blog posts and community solutions. **Present commands for the user to execute** — do not run writes directly. Never assume parameter names; verify via `awsknowledge` MCP tools.

---

## Step 1: Discover and Assess

**Goal:** Understand the current App Runner service configuration.

Ask the user for their App Runner service ARN. Use `awsknowledge` MCP tools to look up the current `describe-service` API syntax, then present the command for the user to run. Extract:

- **Source type** — image-based or source-code-based. If source-code, stop: the user must containerize first (Dockerfile → ECR). Express Mode only accepts images.
- **Container image, port, environment variables** — these transfer directly.
- **CPU and memory** — convert to Fargate units using the mapping in SKILL.md.
- **Instance role** — if set, the app calls AWS APIs at runtime and needs a task role on Express Mode.
- **Health check config** — protocol and path. Express Mode defaults to HTTP on `/ping`.
- **VPC connector** — if egress goes through a VPC, Express Mode must be in the same VPC.
- **Custom domains** — if present, these need reconfiguration on the Express Mode ALB (Step 5).
- **Auto-deploy from ECR** — if enabled, disable it before proceeding.

Present the extracted configuration to the user for confirmation before proceeding.

## Step 2: Prepare IAM Roles

**Goal:** Create the IAM roles Express Mode requires.

Present commands for the user to check if suitable roles already exist before creating new ones. Use `awsknowledge` MCP tools to look up current managed policy names — never hardcode them.

1. **Task execution role** — allows ECS to pull images and write logs.
2. **Infrastructure role** — allows ECS to provision ALB, security groups, auto scaling. **Cannot be changed after service creation.**
3. **Task role (conditional)** — only needed if Step 1 found an App Runner instance role. Either update the existing role's trust policy to also trust ECS, or create a new role with the same permissions.

---

## Step 3: Verify Network Connectivity

**Goal:** Ensure Express Mode can reach the same backends as App Runner.

**If no VPC connector was found in Step 1:** Express Mode will need a VPC. Present commands for the user to verify the default VPC exists in the target region. If the default VPC has been deleted, the user must specify a VPC, subnets, and security groups explicitly.

**If a VPC connector was found:** Present commands for the user to:
- Get the VPC connector's subnets and security groups
- Verify subnets span at least 2 AZs with sufficient free IPs
- Verify internet access exists (NAT Gateway or VPC endpoints)

Record the network configuration for Step 4.

---

## Step 4: Deploy Express Mode Service

**Goal:** Create the Express Mode service with matching configuration.

Use `awsknowledge` MCP tools to look up the current `create-express-gateway-service` API parameters. Present the create command with:
- Container image, port, environment variables, and secrets from Step 1
- CPU and memory in Fargate units from Step 1
- Health check path from Step 1 (set explicitly if different from Express Mode default)
- Task execution role and infrastructure role from Step 2
- Task role from Step 2 (if applicable)
- Network configuration from Step 3 (if applicable)

Use `ecs-mcp` to monitor provisioning and wait for the service to reach ACTIVE status. Retrieve the auto-generated service URL via `ecs-mcp`.

---

## Step 5: Configure Custom Domain (Optional)

**Goal:** Make Express Mode accessible on the same custom domain as App Runner.

Skip if no custom domain was found in Step 1.

→ Load [custom-domain.md](custom-domain.md) for the workflow.

---

## Step 6: Validate

**Goal:** Confirm Express Mode achieves functional parity with App Runner before sending real traffic. Note: behavior will not be identical — auto-scaling, health checks, and load balancing work differently. Focus on verifying that the application responds correctly and backend connectivity works.

Check:

1. **Health** — hit the service URL with the health check path. Expect the same response as App Runner.
2. **Logs** — use `ecs-mcp` to read container logs. Check for startup errors, missing config, connection failures.
3. **Deployment alarm** — use `ecs-mcp` to verify the auto-created CloudWatch alarm is in OK state.
4. **Functional parity** — ask the user to run smoke tests against the Express Mode URL.
5. **Observability** — use `ecs-mcp` to identify the new CloudWatch log group and remind the user to update monitoring tools and dashboards.

**Gate:** Get explicit user confirmation that all checks pass before proceeding.

---

## Step 7: Gradual Traffic Cutover

**Goal:** Shift production traffic from App Runner to Express Mode while minimizing downtime risk. Note: DNS-based cutover cannot guarantee zero downtime — DNS propagation delays, client-side caching, and TTL behavior mean some requests may still reach the old endpoint during transitions.

Present Route 53 weighted routing commands for DNS between App Runner and Express Mode.

**Key rules:**
- Both DNS records must use the **same record type** (both CNAME, or both Alias A). Mixing types breaks weighted routing.
- Zone apex domains (e.g., `example.com`) cannot use CNAME — use Alias A or a subdomain.
- Start with a small percentage on Express Mode and increase gradually.

**Tiered cutover — pick the ramp that matches the service:**

| Service profile | Recommended ramp | Dwell per stage |
|---|---|---|
| **High-traffic / revenue-critical** (>100 req/sec sustained, payments, auth) | 5% → 10% → 25% → 50% → 75% → 100% | 30–60 min, then 24 hr at 100% before decommission |
| **Standard production** (10–100 req/sec, user-facing) | 10% → 50% → 100% | 15–30 min per stage |
| **Low-traffic / internal / staging** (<10 req/sec, tolerant of brief errors) | 50% → 100% **or** single flip | 5–15 min, or skip tiering entirely |
| **Zero live traffic** (cron jobs, async workers, pre-launch services) | Single flip | n/a |

Default to the high-traffic ramp if unsure. Only downgrade to a faster ramp when the user confirms the service profile.

**At each stage, monitor via `ecs-mcp`:**
- ALB 5xx error rate
- ALB target response time
- Target health (healthy host count)
- Application error logs

**Rollback trigger:** If error rates spike or latency degrades, immediately shift all traffic back to App Runner. Load [troubleshooting.md](troubleshooting.md) if needed.

---

## Step 8: Update CI/CD

**Goal:** Point deployment pipelines at Express Mode before decommissioning App Runner.

Use web search for the official GitHub Action for Express Mode deployments. Use `awsknowledge` MCP tools to look up the current `update-express-gateway-service` API syntax for CLI-based pipelines.

Confirm with the user that their pipeline is updated and a test deployment succeeds.

---

## Step 9: Decommission App Runner

**Goal:** Safely remove App Runner after confirming Express Mode handles all traffic.

**Only proceed after 24-48 hours at 100% traffic on Express Mode with no issues.**

**⚠️ Do not execute any deletions automatically.** Present the following as a checklist:

### Recommended sequence:

1. **Pause App Runner service** — stops billing, preserves config for rollback.
2. **Observe for 24-48 more hours.**
3. **Present cleanup checklist** for the user to review individually:

   - [ ] Delete the App Runner service
   - [ ] Remove App Runner IAM access role (if not used elsewhere)
   - [ ] Remove App Runner instance role (if not reused as ECS task role)
   - [ ] Remove VPC connectors used only by App Runner
   - [ ] Remove App Runner custom domain associations
   - [ ] Remove App Runner auto scaling configurations
   - [ ] Remove the App Runner weighted DNS record from Route 53
   - [ ] Convert the Express Mode weighted DNS record to a standard Alias A record
   - [ ] Delete App Runner CloudWatch log groups (if no longer needed)
   - [ ] Delete Express Mode CloudWatch log groups from failed test runs (if any)

For each item the user approves, execute one at a time with confirmation.
