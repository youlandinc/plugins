# Troubleshooting: App Runner to ECS Express Mode Migration

For each issue, use `ecs-mcp` to query live infrastructure and `awsknowledge` MCP tools to verify current API/policy names. Do not guess — diagnose from actual state.

---

## Service Won't Create

**Invalid CPU/memory:** Use `awsknowledge` MCP tools to look up current valid Fargate task sizes. Convert App Runner values using the mapping in SKILL.md.

**Role errors:** Present commands to inspect the role's trust policy. Task execution role must trust the ECS tasks service principal. Infrastructure role must trust the ECS service principal. Use `awsknowledge` MCP tools to look up exact principal names.

**Policy not found:** Use `awsknowledge` MCP tools to look up the current managed policy name for Express Mode infrastructure roles. Policy names can change — never assume them.

**Image pull failure:** Verify the image exists in ECR, the task execution role has the right managed policy, and (if using private subnets) NAT Gateway or VPC endpoints exist for ECR access.

**Subnet issues:** Verify subnets span at least 2 AZs with sufficient free IPs.

## Service Stuck Provisioning

Normal: 2-5 minutes. Monitor status via `ecs-mcp`.

If stuck beyond 10 minutes, present a CloudTrail lookup command to check recent ECS errors.

## Health Check Failures

**Service ACTIVE but health check fails:** Express Mode defaults to HTTP on `/ping`. If the app uses a different path, update the service. Use `ecs-mcp` to read container logs for startup errors.

**Tasks keep restarting:** Use `ecs-mcp` to get the stopped task reason and exit code:
- 137 → OOMKilled → increase memory
- 1 → application error → read logs
- 0 with restart → health check failing → check path and port

## Missing Environment Variables or Secrets

Use `ecs-mcp` to inspect the active service configuration and verify environment variables and secrets match what App Runner had.

If secrets access is denied, check the task execution role's permissions. Advise adding a scoped policy for specific secret ARNs — not a broad read/write policy.

## Custom Domain Issues

**SSL error:** Use `ecs-mcp` to inspect the ALB listener and verify the certificate is attached and covers the domain.

**503 on custom domain:** Use `ecs-mcp` to check the ALB listener rules and verify the host-header condition includes the custom domain.

## Route 53 Weighted Routing Not Working

List the DNS records for the domain. Both records must have the same Name and same Type with different SetIdentifiers.

**Most common mistake:** Mixing CNAME and Alias A record types. Route 53 treats these as separate record sets, not weighted alternatives. Use the same type for both.

**Zone apex:** Root domains (e.g., `example.com`) cannot use CNAME. Use Alias A for both or a subdomain.

## High Error Rate After Traffic Shift

**Immediate action:** Present Route 53 rollback commands — set App Runner weight to 100, Express Mode to 0.

Then use `ecs-mcp` to check ALB target health, container logs, and deployment alarm state.

## Cleanup

**Never manually delete Express Mode managed resources** (ALB, target groups, security groups). The delete API handles this — but always confirm with the user before executing.

**CloudWatch logs persist** after service deletion. Inform the user and let them decide whether to delete.

**Orphaned resources** from manual deletion: suggest force-deleting the service via the API. If that fails, advise opening an AWS Support case.
