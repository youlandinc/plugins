Specialist guidance for Amazon Bedrock. Covers model selection, agent design, knowledge bases, guardrails, prompt engineering, batch inference, and cost optimization.

## Process

1. Understand the workload: what is being built, who consumes it, and what quality bar is required
2. Use the `awsknowledge` MCP tools (`mcp__plugin_aws-dev-toolkit_awsknowledge__aws___search_documentation`, `mcp__plugin_aws-dev-toolkit_awsknowledge__aws___read_documentation`, `mcp__plugin_aws-dev-toolkit_awsknowledge__aws___recommend`) to verify current Bedrock model availability, pricing, and features (these change frequently)
3. Select the right model(s) based on task complexity, latency, and cost
4. Design the architecture: direct invocation, RAG, agent, or multi-agent
5. Configure guardrails for user-facing surfaces
6. Estimate costs using the `references/cost-modeling.md` template
7. Recommend monitoring and cost controls

## Model Selection

The model choice is the single biggest cost and quality decision. Get this right first.

| Need | Recommended Model | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Classification, routing, extraction | Nova Micro or Claude Haiku | Fast, cheap, accurate for structured tasks |
| General Q&A, summarization | Nova Lite or Nova Pro | Strong quality-to-cost ratio |
| Multimodal (image + text) | Nova Lite | Cost-effective vision without Sonnet pricing |
| Complex reasoning, nuanced generation | Claude Sonnet | Best balance of capability and cost |
| Hardest problems, highest quality bar | Claude Opus | Reserve for tasks where Sonnet falls short |
| Embeddings | Titan Embed v2 | Cheaper than Cohere, solid quality for most use cases |
| Code generation | Claude Sonnet | Strong code quality without Opus pricing |

**Note**: Model availability and pricing change frequently. Verify current options via `awsknowledge` MCP tools (`mcp__plugin_aws-dev-toolkit_awsknowledge__aws___search_documentation`, `mcp__plugin_aws-dev-toolkit_awsknowledge__aws___read_documentation`, `mcp__plugin_aws-dev-toolkit_awsknowledge__aws___recommend`) before making final recommendations.

### Model Selection Principles
- Start with the smallest model that could work. Upgrade only when evidence shows it falls short.
- Benchmark on real data, not generic benchmarks. A smaller well-prompted model often beats a larger general one.
- Use Bedrock's intelligent prompt routing to auto-route requests to the right model tier.
- Evaluate the Nova family before defaulting to third-party models — Nova Pro offers comparable quality to Claude Sonnet for many tasks at significantly lower cost per token, and Nova Lite/Micro provide sub-100ms latency for classification and routing tasks where you don't need full reasoning capability. Nova models also have no cross-provider data transfer fees and deeper native Bedrock integration (Guardrails, Knowledge Bases, Flows).

## Bedrock Agents

### Design Principles
- One agent, one job. If the agent description contains "and", consider splitting.
- Fewer tools = fewer reasoning steps = faster + cheaper. 3-5 tools is the sweet spot.
- Use direct `InvokeModel` for simple tasks. Not everything needs an agent.

### Architecture Patterns

**Router + Specialists**: A lightweight classifier (Nova Micro) routes to specialized agents. Each specialist has a focused tool set and optimized prompt. This beats one mega-agent with 20 tools.

**Knowledge Base + Guardrails**: For customer-facing Q&A — KB for retrieval, guardrails for safety, single model call for generation. No agent orchestration needed; use `RetrieveAndGenerate` API directly.

**Agent with Session Memory**: For multi-turn conversations — use AgentCore sessions with memory. Let the agent maintain context across turns instead of stuffing history into the prompt each time.

### Action Groups
- Use Lambda-backed action groups for complex logic
- Use Return Control for client-side tool execution (keeps agent stateless, avoids Lambda cost)
- Define OpenAPI schemas tightly — vague schemas cause the model to guess (and guess wrong)

## Knowledge Bases

### Chunking Strategy
- **Fixed-size chunking** (default): Good starting point. 300-500 tokens with 10-20% overlap.
- **Semantic chunking**: Better quality, higher embedding cost. Use for high-value, heterogeneous documents.
- **Hierarchical chunking**: Best for long documents with clear structure (manuals, legal docs).
- Curate the data source — garbage in, garbage out applies doubly to RAG.

### Vector Store Selection
- **OpenSearch Serverless**: Default choice. Managed, scales, integrates natively. See `references/cost-modeling.md` for minimum costs.
- **Aurora PostgreSQL (pgvector)**: Good if already running Aurora — consolidates infrastructure.
- **Pinecone / Redis**: If existing investments in these stores.
- For PoCs, share a single OpenSearch Serverless collection across multiple KBs to minimize cost.

### Retrieval Tuning
- Start with hybrid search (semantic + keyword) — outperforms pure semantic for most workloads
- Tune retrieved chunk count (default 5). More chunks = more context = more input tokens. Find the minimum that gives good answers.
- Use metadata filtering to scope retrieval — avoid searching everything when the document category is known.

## Prompt Engineering on Bedrock

### Prompt Caching
- Bedrock caches repeated system prompts automatically for supported models
- Structure prompts: long, stable system prompt + short, variable user prompt
- Cached input tokens are up to 90% cheaper — structure prompts to maximize cache hits

### Prompt Management
- Use Bedrock's Prompt Management to version and manage prompts
- Treat prompts like code — version them, test them, review changes
- Use prompt variables for dynamic content instead of string concatenation

### Structured Output
- Request JSON with explicit schemas to reduce output token waste
- Use the Converse API with tool use for structured extraction — more reliable than asking for JSON in the prompt

## Batch Inference
- 50% cheaper than on-demand for supported models
- Use for: document processing, bulk classification, dataset enrichment, eval runs
- Not for: real-time user-facing requests (latency is minutes to hours)
- Submit jobs via S3 input/output — fits naturally into data pipelines

## Guardrails
- Apply to user-facing inputs and outputs. Skip for internal agent reasoning steps.
- Content filters are cheaper than denied topic policies — use filters for broad categories, denied topics for specific restrictions.
- Contextual grounding checks catch hallucination at inference time — useful for RAG apps.
- PII detection/redaction is built in — use it instead of building custom regex.

## Diagnostic CLI Commands

Resource creation belongs in IaC. Use the `iac-scaffold` skill for templates.

```bash
# List available models in the region
aws bedrock list-foundation-models \
  --query 'modelSummaries[].{id:modelId,name:modelName,provider:providerName}' --output table

# Quick model test (Converse API — preferred over invoke-model)
aws bedrock-runtime converse \
  --model-id amazon.nova-micro-v1:0 \
  --messages '[{"role":"user","content":[{"text":"Hello"}]}]'

# List agents
aws bedrock-agent list-agents --output table

# List knowledge bases
aws bedrock-agent list-knowledge-bases --output table

# List guardrails
aws bedrock list-guardrails --output table

# Check model invocation logging status
aws bedrock get-model-invocation-logging-configuration
```

## Anti-Patterns

- **Defaulting to the biggest model "just to be safe"** — start small, upgrade with evidence
- **Building an agent when a single InvokeModel call would do** — agents compound cost per turn
- **Stuffing entire documents into prompts instead of using Knowledge Bases** — RAG is cheaper and more maintainable
- **Ignoring prompt caching** — it is automatic for supported models, just structure prompts correctly
- **Using on-demand for bulk processing that could be batch** — 50% savings left on the table
- **One massive Knowledge Base instead of scoped, curated collections** — hurts retrieval quality and costs more
- **Skipping guardrails on user-facing apps** — "we'll add them later" becomes a security incident
- **Not monitoring token usage** — costs sneak up fast during iteration, especially with agents
