Specialist guidance for Amazon Bedrock AgentCore. Covers the full platform: Runtime, Memory, Gateway, Identity, Policy, Code Interpreter, Browser, Observability, and Evaluations. Framework-agnostic and model-agnostic.

## Process

1. Identify the agent workload: purpose, framework (Strands, LangGraph, custom), model requirements, tool integrations, latency/duration needs
2. Use the `awsknowledge` MCP tools (`mcp__plugin_aws-dev-toolkit_awsknowledge__aws___search_documentation`, `mcp__plugin_aws-dev-toolkit_awsknowledge__aws___read_documentation`, `mcp__plugin_aws-dev-toolkit_awsknowledge__aws___recommend`) to verify current AgentCore quotas, regional availability, and API changes
3. Select the appropriate AgentCore services for the workload (not every agent needs every service)
4. Design the deployment topology: Runtime config, memory strategy, tool connectivity, identity model
5. Configure security: Identity, Policy (Cedar), VPC connectivity, guardrails
6. Set up observability and evaluations from day one
7. Plan the PoC-to-production migration path

## AgentCore Service Selection Matrix

| Requirement | Service | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Deploy and scale agents serverlessly | **Runtime** | Secure, framework-agnostic hosting with session isolation, auto-scaling, consumption-based pricing |
| Conversation history and learned context | **Memory** | Short-term (session) and long-term (episodic) memory without managing infrastructure |
| Expose APIs/Lambda as agent tools | **Gateway** | Converts existing APIs and Lambda functions into MCP-compatible tools, handles auth |
| Agent-to-third-party auth (OAuth, API keys) | **Identity** | Manages workload identities, OAuth2 token exchange, API key vaults |
| Control what agents can do with tools | **Policy** | Cedar-based deterministic enforcement at the Gateway boundary, natural language authoring |
| Execute code in sandbox | **Code Interpreter** | Isolated sandbox for Python execution, file I/O, data analysis |
| Browse web pages programmatically | **Browser** | Cloud-based browser runtime for web interaction at scale |
| Trace, debug, monitor agent behavior | **Observability** | OpenTelemetry-compatible traces to CloudWatch/X-Ray, unified dashboards |
| Test and score agent quality | **Evaluations** | 13 built-in evaluators, custom scoring, continuous monitoring |

## When You Need Each Service

### Always Start With
- **Runtime** — every production agent needs managed hosting
- **Observability** — instrument from day one, not after the first incident

### Add Based on Workload
- **Memory** — when agents need conversation continuity or personalization
- **Gateway** — when agents call external APIs or Lambda functions (most agents)
- **Identity** — when agents access third-party services requiring OAuth or API keys
- **Policy** — when you need deterministic guardrails on tool usage (compliance, financial, PII)

### Add for Specialized Capabilities
- **Code Interpreter** — data analysis agents, code generation agents
- **Browser** — web scraping, form-filling, UI testing agents
- **Evaluations** — continuous quality monitoring (should be added before production)

## Runtime

AgentCore Runtime is a serverless, purpose-built hosting environment for AI agents.

### Key Capabilities
- Framework-agnostic: Strands Agents, LangGraph, custom Python, any framework
- Model-agnostic: any foundation model (Bedrock, self-hosted, third-party)
- Session isolation: each user session runs in its own execution context
- Supports real-time conversations (<1s latency) through to 8-hour async workloads
- Bidirectional streaming (WebSocket) for natural conversations
- Consumption-based pricing: CPU + memory billed per-second (1-second minimum)
- A2A (Agent-to-Agent) protocol support for cross-framework multi-agent systems

### Development vs Production Deployment

**Development and testing**: Use the AgentCore CLI or Starter Toolkit for fast iteration — scaffolding, local dev, quick deploys, and testing.

**Production**: Define all AgentCore resources in IaC (CDK, Terraform, CloudFormation, or SAM). CLI-created resources are useful for prototyping but should not be the source of truth for production infrastructure. The Starter Toolkit's CDK templates are a solid starting point for production IaC.

### Deployment Options
- **AgentCore CLI** (dev/test): Fastest path — `agentcore init` → `agentcore deploy` in minutes
- **Starter Toolkit** (reference IaC): Full-stack CDK template with auth, frontend, and all services pre-wired — fork and customize for production
- **CDK / Terraform / SAM** (production): Define resources in IaC, deploy via CI/CD pipeline
- **Container image** (manual): Docker image pushed to ECR, deployed to Runtime — full control over build

## AgentCore CLI

The [AgentCore CLI](https://github.com/aws/agentcore-cli) is the preferred tool for scaffolding, local development, and rapid iteration on agents. It abstracts away container builds, ECR pushes, and runtime configuration into simple commands. Use it for dev/test workflows — for production, define the same resources in IaC.

### Install

```bash
pip install agentcore-cli
```

### Quick Start

```bash
# Initialize a new agent project (choose framework: strands, langgraph, or custom)
agentcore init my-agent --framework strands

# Develop locally
cd my-agent
agentcore dev

# Deploy to AgentCore Runtime
agentcore deploy --region us-east-1

# Test the deployed agent
agentcore invoke --agent-name my-agent --input "Hello, what can you do?"
```

### What the CLI Handles
- **Project scaffolding**: generates agent code, Dockerfile, requirements, and config
- **Local development**: `agentcore dev` runs the agent locally with hot-reload
- **Build + push**: builds the Docker container, pushes to ECR automatically
- **Deploy**: creates/updates the agent runtime and endpoint
- **Invoke**: test deployed agents from the command line
- **Alias management**: create and update aliases for version routing

### CLI vs Direct AWS CLI

| Task | AgentCore CLI | AWS CLI |
|---|---|---|
| Create new agent | `agentcore init` | Manual Dockerfile + ECR + create-agent-runtime |
| Deploy | `agentcore deploy` | docker build + docker push + create/update API calls |
| Local dev | `agentcore dev` | Manual server setup |
| Test | `agentcore invoke` | `aws bedrock-agentcore invoke-agent-runtime` |

Use the AgentCore CLI for day-to-day development and testing. For production, define the equivalent resources in CDK, Terraform, or CloudFormation — the CLI is great for proving out configurations quickly, but IaC is the source of truth for production infrastructure.

## Starter Toolkit (FAST Template)

The [AgentCore Starter Toolkit](https://github.com/aws/bedrock-agentcore-starter-toolkit) provides a full-stack CDK reference architecture. Use it when you need a complete production deployment with authentication, frontend, and all AgentCore services wired together.

### What It Provides
- **CDK infrastructure**: Full IaC for Runtime, Gateway, Memory, Code Interpreter, and Observability — one `cdk deploy`
- **Auth integration**: Amazon Cognito authentication pre-wired for frontend → Runtime, agents → Gateway, and API Gateway
- **Frontend template**: React app with streamable HTTP for real-time agent response streaming via CloudFront
- **Framework templates**: Pre-built agent patterns for Strands Agents and LangGraph (framework-agnostic by design)
- **CI/CD patterns**: GitHub Actions workflow for build, scan (Amazon Inspector), deploy, and alias management
- **Observability**: AWS OpenTelemetry Distro auto-instrumentation for traces → X-Ray, metrics/logs → CloudWatch

### Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aws/bedrock-agentcore-starter-toolkit.git
cd bedrock-agentcore-starter-toolkit
pip install -r requirements.txt
cdk deploy --all
```

### Architecture

The Fullstack AgentCore Solution Template (FAST) deploys:

```
CloudFront (React frontend)
  → Cognito (auth)
    → AgentCore Runtime (agent hosting)
      → AgentCore Memory (conversation + episodic)
      → AgentCore Gateway (MCP-compatible tools)
      → AgentCore Code Interpreter (Python sandbox)
      → AgentCore Observability → CloudWatch + X-Ray
```

Four authentication integration points are handled automatically:
1. User sign-in to the frontend
2. Frontend → AgentCore Runtime (token-based)
3. Agent → AgentCore Gateway (token-based)
4. API requests → API Gateway (token-based)

### Tooling Decision Matrix

| Phase | Use | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Scaffolding + local dev | **AgentCore CLI** | `init` → `dev` in minutes, hot-reload |
| Quick PoC deployment | **AgentCore CLI** | `deploy` handles container build, ECR, runtime creation |
| Full-stack reference architecture | **Starter Toolkit** | CDK deploys Runtime + Gateway + Memory + Cognito + CloudFront |
| Production resource definition | **CDK / Terraform / SAM** | IaC is the source of truth — reproducible, reviewable, auditable |
| Add agent to existing IaC | **CDK construct or Terraform resource** | Integrate into your existing infrastructure code |
| Learn AgentCore end-to-end | **Starter Toolkit** | Extensively documented, AI-dev friendly, fork as your production IaC starting point |

### Runtime Configuration

| Setting | Recommendation | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| CPU/Memory | Start with 1 vCPU / 2 GiB | Scale based on model inference needs and tool call overhead |
| Session TTL | 600s for real-time, up to 28,800s for async | Idle sessions consume resources |
| VPC connectivity | Enable for agents accessing private resources | Uses ENIs in your VPC |
| Endpoint type | Use agent endpoints for routing | Supports alias-based traffic splitting |

### Production Deployment Pattern
1. Define all AgentCore resources in IaC (CDK, Terraform, or CloudFormation) — Runtime, Gateway, Memory, Identity, Policy
2. Build agent container with AgentCore SDK decorators (CI/CD pipeline)
3. Push to ECR via pipeline (not manual `docker push`)
4. Deploy via `cdk deploy` / `terraform apply` / CloudFormation changeset
5. Create aliases for version management in IaC (never use TSTALIASID in production)
6. Configure resource-based policies for cross-account access if needed
7. Use the AgentCore CLI's `agentcore invoke` for smoke testing deployed agents

## Memory

### Short-Term Memory
- Session-scoped conversation history
- Automatic — enabled by default in Runtime
- Maintains context within a single conversation

### Long-Term Memory
- Persists across sessions — agent learns and adapts over time
- Episodic memory: stores extracted insights from past interactions
- Extraction jobs process conversation transcripts into retrievable knowledge
- Consumption-based pricing for storage and retrieval

### When to Use Long-Term Memory
- Customer support agents that need to remember past interactions
- Personal assistant agents that build user profiles over time
- Agents that should improve with repeated use

### When to Skip Long-Term Memory
- Stateless utility agents (code formatters, calculators)
- Agents where session isolation is a compliance requirement
- Simple single-turn tool-calling agents

## Gateway

Converts existing APIs, Lambda functions, and services into MCP-compatible tools that any agent framework can consume.

### Key Patterns
- **Lambda targets**: point Gateway at a Lambda function, it becomes an MCP tool
- **API targets**: wrap REST/HTTP APIs as agent-callable tools
- **MCP server federation**: connect to existing MCP servers
- Tools are automatically indexed and discoverable by agents
- Policy enforcement happens at the Gateway boundary

### Gateway + Policy Integration
Gateway intercepts all agent-to-tool traffic. Policy evaluates Cedar rules against each request before allowing or denying. This separation means:
- Security teams write policies without touching agent code
- Policies are deterministic (not LLM-based)
- Audit logging captures every allow/deny decision

## Identity

Manages how agents authenticate to third-party services and AWS resources.

### Workload Identities
- Each agent runtime gets an identity
- Supports IAM role assumption for AWS resources
- OAuth2 token exchange for third-party services (Salesforce, Jira, etc.)
- API key vault for services requiring static credentials
- Custom claims support for enhanced authentication

### Best Practice
- Use workload identities instead of embedding credentials in agent code
- Store OAuth client secrets in token vaults, not Secrets Manager (AgentCore manages rotation)
- Use resource-based policies to scope cross-account access

## Policy

Deterministic control over agent-tool interactions using Cedar language.

### How It Works
1. Create a Policy Engine and attach it to a Gateway
2. Write Cedar policies (or author in natural language — AgentCore converts to Cedar)
3. Gateway intercepts tool calls and evaluates against policies in real-time
4. Allow/deny decisions are logged for audit

### Common Policy Patterns

| Pattern | Cedar Example | Use Case |
|---|---|---|
| Amount limits | `forbid when { resource.refundAmount > 1000 }` | Financial guardrails |
| User-scoped access | `permit when { principal.department == "engineering" }` | Role-based tool access |
| Tool restriction | `forbid action == Action::"invoke" when { resource.toolName == "deleteUser" }` | Prevent dangerous operations |
| Time-based | `permit when { context.hour >= 9 && context.hour <= 17 }` | Business-hours-only actions |

### Policy vs Bedrock Guardrails
- **Policy**: controls *what tools* an agent can call and *with what parameters* — deterministic, Cedar-based
- **Guardrails**: controls *what content* an agent can produce — LLM-based content filtering, PII detection
- Use both: Policy for tool-level control, Guardrails for content-level control

## Multi-Agent Architectures

### Bedrock Multi-Agent Collaboration (Managed)
- Supervisor agent orchestrates collaborator agents
- Built-in task delegation and response aggregation
- Each agent has its own tools, knowledge bases, guardrails
- Best for: teams wanting managed orchestration with minimal custom code

### A2A Protocol (Agent-to-Agent)
- Cross-framework interoperability (Strands + LangGraph + custom agents can communicate)
- Agents advertise capabilities via Agent Cards
- Task-based request lifecycle with artifacts
- OAuth 2.0 and IAM authentication for secure inter-agent communication
- Best for: heterogeneous agent ecosystems, cross-team agent integration

### Agents-as-Tools Pattern
- Specialized agents registered as tools of a supervisor agent
- All agents run within the same AgentCore Runtime
- Supervisor selects and delegates dynamically
- Best for: monolithic deployments where all agents are owned by one team

### Architecture Decision

| Factor | Multi-Agent Collaboration | A2A Protocol | Agents-as-Tools |
|---|---|---|---|
| Framework flexibility | Bedrock Agents only | Any framework | Any framework (same runtime) |
| Cross-account | No | Yes | No |
| Managed orchestration | Yes | No (custom) | Partial |
| Setup complexity | Low | Medium-High | Low |
| Best for | All-in on Bedrock Agents | Cross-team, heterogeneous | Single-team, single runtime |

## Anti-Patterns

- **Using TSTALIASID in production.** Create proper aliases with version pinning. Test aliases have no SLA and no rollback capability.
- **Skipping observability until "later".** Instrument from day one. Debugging an unobservable agent in production is flying blind.
- **God agent that does everything.** If you need "and" in the agent's job description, you need two agents. Decompose into focused, composable agents.
- **Embedding credentials in agent instructions or environment variables.** Use AgentCore Identity for OAuth/API keys, IAM roles for AWS resources.
- **Not setting session TTLs.** Idle sessions consume compute resources. Set appropriate TTLs based on actual usage patterns.
- **Skipping Policy for tool access.** Without Policy, any agent can call any tool with any parameters. In production, that is a compliance and security gap.
- **Over-engineering the PoC.** Ship something that works with Runtime + Observability first. Add Memory, Gateway, Policy as needs emerge.
- **Ignoring token costs during development.** Track token usage per agent/session from the start. Costs compound fast with multi-step reasoning loops.
- **Manual prompt management.** Treat system prompts like code — version control, review, test. Prompt drift is a production incident waiting to happen.
- **Not evaluating before production.** Run evals (built-in or DeepEval) in CI/CD. "It looks right" is not a quality gate.
- **CLI-deployed resources as production infrastructure.** The AgentCore CLI is excellent for dev/test, but production resources should be defined in IaC (CDK, Terraform, CloudFormation). CLI-created resources are not version-controlled, not reproducible, and not auditable.

## Pricing Model

AgentCore uses consumption-based pricing across all services — no upfront commitments.

| Service | Billing Unit | Key Detail |
|---|---|---|
| Runtime | CPU-seconds + memory-seconds | 1-second minimum, active consumption only |
| Memory | Storage + retrieval operations | Short-term included with Runtime sessions |
| Gateway | API calls + search queries + tool indexing | Per-request pricing |
| Identity | Token/key requests for non-AWS resources | Per-request pricing |
| Policy | Authorization requests + NL authoring tokens | Per-request pricing |
| Code Interpreter | CPU-seconds + memory-seconds | Per-session, 1-second minimum |
| Browser | CPU-seconds + memory-seconds | Per-session, 1-second minimum |
| Observability | Telemetry generated + stored + queried | Similar to CloudWatch pricing model |
| Evaluations | Built-in evaluator invocations + custom evals | Per-evaluation pricing |

## Regional Availability

AgentCore services are available across multiple regions. Core services (Runtime, Memory, Gateway, Identity) are available in: us-east-1, us-east-2, us-west-2, ap-southeast-1, ap-southeast-2, ap-south-1, ap-northeast-1, eu-west-1, eu-central-1. Check the `awsknowledge` MCP tools (`mcp__plugin_aws-dev-toolkit_awsknowledge__aws___search_documentation`, `mcp__plugin_aws-dev-toolkit_awsknowledge__aws___read_documentation`, `mcp__plugin_aws-dev-toolkit_awsknowledge__aws___recommend`) for the latest regional availability, as new regions are added regularly.
