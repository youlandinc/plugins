# aws-dev-toolkit

A Claude Code plugin for building, migrating, and performing architecture reviews on AWS. Ships 34 skills, 11 sub-agents, and 3 MCP servers.

## Installation

```bash
# Add the marketplace
/plugin marketplace add aws-samples/sample-claude-code-plugins-for-startups

# Install the plugin
/plugin install aws-dev-toolkit@aws-samples
```

Or load locally during development:

```bash
claude --plugin-dir ./plugins/aws-dev-toolkit
```

## Prerequisites

- [Claude Code](https://code.claude.com) v1.0.33+
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) (for MCP servers via `uvx`)
- AWS CLI configured with appropriate credentials
- (Optional) `checkov`, `cfn-nag`, `tfsec` for security scanning

## Usage

Most skills activate automatically based on context. Just ask naturally:

```
"Review this architecture for Well-Architected best practices"  → aws-architect
"Why is my CloudFormation stack failing?"                       → aws-debug
"Compare ECS vs EKS for my workload"                            → aws-compare
"Help me optimize my AWS bill"                                  → cost-optimizer agent
```

Some skills are invoked explicitly via slash commands:

```
/aws-dev-toolkit:iac-scaffold cdk "Serverless API with Lambda and DynamoDB"
/aws-dev-toolkit:aws-health-check us-east-1
/aws-dev-toolkit:aws-diagram from-iac
/aws-dev-toolkit:strands-agent "Document processing pipeline"
```
