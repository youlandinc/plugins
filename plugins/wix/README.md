# Wix Skills

> ⚠️ **EXPERIMENTAL**: This project is in early development. APIs, skill definitions, and behavior may change without notice. Use at your own risk.

Agent skills for building Wix app extensions, managing Wix business solutions, developing headless sites, and using the Wix Design System with AI agents.

> **Note**: These skills are designed for the **new Wix CLI**. See [About the Wix CLI](https://dev.wix.com/docs/wix-cli/guides/about-the-wix-cli) to learn more. For an overview of how skills work with AI tools, see [About Wix Skills](https://dev.wix.com/docs/api-reference/articles/ai-tools/about-wix-skills).

| [wix-design-system](skills/wix-design-system/SKILL.md) | Wix Design System reference      | Looking up WDS component props, examples, icons                                                                                     |

| [wix-headless](skills/wix-headless/SKILL.md) | Connect Wix business services to a headless frontend (SDK + Wix CLI), and optionally build & host the site | Setting up a Wix Headless backend or adding Wix business features (Stores, Bookings, CMS, Blog, Events, Forms, Members, Restaurants, Portfolio, Pricing Plans) — install apps, seed content, and produce an SDK-integration guide; for managed projects also scaffold a new site (create) or wire an existing design (connect), then build and release.

Referenced by the other skills as their docs-lookup fallback |

## Versioning

`@wix/agent-skills` follows semver. Bumps target **AI-generated-code stability** — i.e., whether a change could cause an agent using these skills to produce broken code on the previous-major `wix-cli`:

| Bump | Examples |
| --- | --- |
| **patch** | Wording fix, typo, link update, clarification of existing guidance |
| **minor** | New skill added, new section in an existing skill, additive guidance for a non-breaking `wix-cli` feature |
| **major** | Skill rename/removal, rewrite of guidance for a deprecated `wix-cli` API, anything that would cause AI-generated code to fail on the previous-major `wix-cli` |

When a major bump is required (a breaking change in the underlying `wix-cli`), the previous major continues on a `release/<N>.x` maintenance branch and receives backports for genuine bugs only — no new features.

## Releasing

Run the [`release-bump`](.github/workflows/release-bump.yml) workflow from the **Actions** tab and pick a `version_strategy`. The rest is automatic — the bump PR auto-merges once checks pass and [`release.yml`](.github/workflows/release.yml) publishes to npm via Trusted Publishing.

## Contributing

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidelines on adding new skills.

### Eval Token Budgets

Eval scenarios under `yaml/wix-manage-evals/` may define a top-level `maxTokens` value. The GitHub Actions eval gate compares that budget against the PR run's total tokens for the scenario and fails the PR check when the budget is exceeded. This gate-owned field is separate from `llm_judge.maxTokens`, which only configures the judge assertion.
