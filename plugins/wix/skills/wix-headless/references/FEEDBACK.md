# Feedback — relay the user's Wix Headless experience to Wix

A tiny, optional capability: send the **user's** feedback about the Wix Headless *building
experience* to Wix. It posts to Wix's internal `#headless-user-feedback` channel, attributed to the
authenticated user. Use it to close the loop when the skill itself, the APIs, the docs, or the
tooling got in the user's way — the signal is how Wix improves the headless flow.

This is **not** support, and not for the user's own site content. It is meta-feedback about *using
Wix Headless*.

## When to offer it (user-approved only — never auto-send)

Sending is always the user's call. Offer once, in plain prose, in any of these situations; send only
after an explicit yes:

- The user **explicitly asks** to send feedback / report something to Wix ("tell Wix that…", "report
  this", "send feedback"). Then just confirm the wording and send.
- The user **complains, is frustrated, or reports a Wix bug** in the course of the work ("this API is
  broken", "the docs are wrong", "why is this so hard"). Acknowledge, then offer to pass it on.
- **The run hit substantial friction** — repeated API failures, wrong/missing docs, a tooling dead
  end, or a workaround you had to invent. When you notice the pattern, offer: *"This tripped us up a
  few times — want me to send it to Wix as headless feedback?"*

Do **not** send on a single transient error, on the user's behalf without a yes, or more than once
for the same issue. When unsure, ask rather than send.

## Compose a useful message

The channel receives only free text plus the user's id, so a bare sentence is low-signal. Send a
**summary of the whole run**, not just the last error — you have the full session context that Wix
does not. Lead with a details header so Wix can triage without chasing you, then the narrative.

**Start with an identifiers block** — labelled lines, omit any that don't apply:

```
Metasite / siteId: <id>
Public clientId (app id): <id>
Site links: <dashboard/editor URL> · <live or preview URL if released>
Project type / frontend: <managed | self-managed | stripe> · <Astro | …>
Skill area(s): <recipe/file(s) involved, e.g. inline-recipes/setup-bookings.md STEP 5>
Other ids: <service / product / checkout / etc. ids created this run, as relevant>
```

**Then the body:**

- **Run summary** — the arc of the session in a few sentences: what the user set out to build
  (goal + capabilities: storefront, bookings, events, blog…) and how it went end to end (what
  worked cleanly vs. what fought back).
- **Friction points** — the heart of it. Walk the flow and list every place the skill, an API, the
  docs, or the tooling got in the way, each with specifics: the step/endpoint, the HTTP status and
  error message, the doc/tooling gap, and any workaround you had to invent. Include the ones you
  recovered from — a silent retry that eventually worked is exactly the signal Wix wants.
- **What was expected** — and a minimal repro where there is one.
- **Bottom line** — one or two sentences naming the single most important problem and its impact or
  severity (e.g. "a documented PATCH returns 200 but silently drops the field, so a photo-forward
  site nearly shipped with no images"). Be direct and candid about how bad it was — but keep a
  **professional register**: a concise engineering assessment, not a persona, jokes, or theatrics.

Write it as a scannable few paragraphs or a short bulleted list — thorough on the friction, distilled
from the conversation rather than a raw transcript dump, and professional throughout. Confirm the
final wording with the user before sending. **Never include secrets** — no bearer tokens, refresh
tokens, API keys, or credentials — and no personal data beyond what the feedback needs.

## Send it

This call identifies **you** (the human account), not a site, so it needs a **user-scoped** bearer —
mint it with **no `--site` flag**: `npx @wix/cli@latest token`. Do **not** reuse the
`token --site "$SITE_ID"` bearer that `AUTHENTICATION.md` mints for the content APIs: that token
carries a `metaSiteId` and the feedback service reads it as the site's app/visitor identity, so it
can't resolve a user and rejects the message as anonymous (see the `500` case below). Send **only the
bearer**, **no `wix-site-id` header**. If the CLI isn't logged in yet (e.g. feedback comes up before
any site exists), authenticate first (`AUTHENTICATION.md` §1), then run `token` (no `--site`).

```bash
TOKEN=$(npx @wix/cli@latest token)   # NO --site: user-scoped, or the send is rejected as anonymous
curl -sS -w "\nHTTP_STATUS:%{http_code}" \
  -X POST "https://www.wixapis.com/mcp-serverless/v1/headless-feedback" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message":"<composed feedback>"}'
```

- **Success = `HTTP_STATUS:200`** with an empty body `{}`. Tell the user it was sent.
- **`500` `"Unable to determine target user id, anonymous messages are not allowed"`** — you sent a
  **site-scoped** token (minted with `--site`). Re-mint **without** `--site`
  (`npx @wix/cli@latest token`) and retry once.
- **`401`/`403`** — the CLI session expired or the token isn't user-identifiable; re-authenticate
  (`AUTHENTICATION.md` §1), re-mint (no `--site`), retry once. If it still fails, surface the response
  and stop — do not loop.

## Hard rules

- ✅ Send only after an explicit user yes — offering is fine, sending unprompted is not.
- ✅ One submission per issue; never spam the channel with retries or duplicates.
- ✅ Compose a specific, factual message; confirm the wording first.
- ❌ Never include tokens, secrets, credentials, or unnecessary personal data in the message.
- ❌ Never use this for the user's site content or as a support channel — it's headless-experience feedback.
