description: "Client-only, dependency-free REST scaffolds for connecting an already-built front end (a vibe-coded app, an HTML/JSX/Vite project, a design-tool export) to a live Wix site over the site's public WIX_CLIENT_ID — the browser talks to Wix directly, no SDK, no backend, no build step. One skill covering every Wix business solution: Stores/eCommerce storefront (products, cart, checkout), Bookings (services, slots, appointments), Blog (posts, categories, tags), Events & Tickets (browse, RSVP, ticketing), Portfolio (collections, projects, galleries), Restaurants (menu, online ordering, reservations), CMS / Wix Data (list, detail, filter, forms, CRUD), and Pricing Plans (memberships, subscriptions, checkout). Each vertical ships a copy-as-is REST layer plus wiring instructions. Read-only over the owner's content — never provisions, never mocks data. Triggers: connect my Wix store/shop, build a storefront over Wix, add a cart and checkout, connect Wix Bookings, take appointments/reservations, show my Wix blog, list my Wix events, sell tickets, take RSVPs, build a portfolio from Wix Portfolio, show my restaurant menu / order online / book a table, display my Wix CMS collection, wire a contact form to Wix, sell membership/subscription plans, 'here is my WIX_CLIENT_ID', connect this app to my Wix site over REST. Use this for CLIENT-ONLY REST integration over an existing site; use `wix-headless` instead for SDK + Wix CLI builds, hosting, and one-prompt new-site creation."

# Wix Vibe Headless — client-only REST connectors

Wire an existing front end to a live Wix site **from the browser**, over the site's public
`WIX_CLIENT_ID`, using hand-rolled REST — **no `@wix/sdk`, no backend, no build step, no
dependencies**. One skill, one shared transport, and a copy-as-is REST layer per Wix
business solution. Everything is **read-only over the owner's content**: render live Wix
data or an honest empty state — **never mock, never provision, never invent** products,
posts, events, menus, plans, reviews, or counts.

## When to use this skill

- The user has (or is building) a front end — a vibe-coded app, plain HTML/JSX, a Vite/React
  project, a design-tool export — and wants it to show **live data from their existing Wix
  site** and complete real purchases/bookings, all from the client.
- They hand you a **public `WIX_CLIENT_ID`** and ask to "connect this to my Wix store /
  blog / bookings / events / …".
- They want to replace placeholder/mock data with real Wix content, or add a cart, checkout,
  booking, RSVP, ticketing, reservation, form, or subscribe flow over an app they already have.

## When NOT to use this skill

| Scenario | Use instead |
|---|---|
| Build a **new** Wix site end-to-end from one prompt (discovery → design → build → host) | `wix-headless` |
| The project should use the **Wix SDK** (`@wix/sdk`) and/or the **Wix CLI**, or be **hosted on Wix** | `wix-headless` |
| Manage/configure the site via REST (install apps, seed catalogs, set up business solutions) | `wix-manage` |
| Build a Wix **app extension** (dashboard page, widget, backend, plugin) | `wix-app` |

This skill is the deliberately **client-only, REST-only** path. It is independent from
`wix-headless` (which is SDK + CLI + hosting) — do not mix the two in one project.

## The shared model (applies to every vertical)

- **Auth = one public client id.** `WIX_CLIENT_ID` is a **buyer/visitor-facing** credential —
  it only mints anonymous visitor tokens. It is **not a secret**; hardcoding and committing it
  is fine. The user provides it (their vibe/host platform surfaces a copyable prompt with the
  id filled in). Paste it into `wix-client.js` in place of the `<YOUR-CLIENT-ID>` placeholder.
- **Visitor token = identity.** `wix-client.js` mints an anonymous visitor token, persists the
  **refresh token to `localStorage`**, and refreshes on expiry. That token IS the identity of
  the cart / reservation / member session — **never re-mint anonymously per load** or the cart
  silently empties.
- **Never mock, never provision.** These scaffolds are read-only over the owner's content. The
  owner adds products/posts/services/events/menus/plans in the **Wix dashboard**. If a
  collection is empty, show the empty state — never fabricate data, reviews, ratings, or counts.
- **Purchases go through Wix.** Checkout/ticketing/plan purchase always complete via the Wix
  redirect-session / Wix-hosted form — **never hand-build a `/checkout` or purchase URL**.
- **Fail loudly.** The helpers throw on out-of-stock, empty carts, unbookable slots, expired
  holds, and payment-still-owed. A green path means it really worked — don't swallow the error.
- **Beyond the snippets, look it up — never guess.** The templates and the shipped
  `references/<vertical>/` helpers are the implementation — build from them first. When you hit a
  genuine gap (a field, an endpoint, or an error the snippets don't cover), extend the client with
  `wixApiRequest` — confirming the exact endpoint, method, and body first. **For that iteration and
  troubleshooting** — finding the right endpoint, reading a method's request/response schema, or
  diagnosing an API error — fall back to the **`wix-docs`** skill (`../wix-docs/SKILL.md` when
  co-installed): it covers `curl` doc-search, reading pages, and structured API-spec queries.

## How this skill is structured

`<SKILL_ROOT>` is this file's directory (strip `/SKILL.md`). Two files make up each vertical's
runtime:

1. **The shared transport** — `references/shared/wix-client.js`. **Identical for every vertical.**
   Copy it once into the app's `src/rest/` and set `WIX_CLIENT_ID` in it.
2. **The vertical helper** — `references/<vertical>/<helper>.js`. Copy it into the **same**
   `src/rest/` folder (it does `import { wixApiRequest } from "./wix-client.js"`, so the two
   files must sit side by side).

Each vertical's `INSTRUCTIONS.md` is the full playbook for that solution: when to use it,
prerequisites, the exported API, how to wire it, the hard rules, and a verification checklist.
**Open the relevant `INSTRUCTIONS.md` before wiring** — the shapes and gotchas live there.

## Routing — pick the vertical(s) from the request

Load the vertical(s) the user's app needs; a project may combine several (e.g. a restaurant
with a blog, or a store with pricing plans).

| The user wants… | Vertical | Read | Helper(s) to copy (+ `shared/wix-client.js`) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Online store: products, categories, cart, checkout | **storefront** | `references/storefront/INSTRUCTIONS.md` | `wix-store-catalog.js` + `wix-store-cart.js` |
| Appointments: services, time slots, booking, checkout | **bookings** | `references/bookings/INSTRUCTIONS.md` | `wix-bookings-services.js` + `wix-bookings-checkout.js` |
| Blog/news: post feed, post pages, categories, tags | **blog** | `references/blog/INSTRUCTIONS.md` | `references/blog/wix-blog.js` |
| Events: browse, event page, RSVP, ticketing | **events** | `references/events/INSTRUCTIONS.md` | `wix-events-browse.js` (always) + `wix-events-registration.js` (RSVP/tickets) |
| Portfolio/showcase: collections, projects, media galleries | **portfolio** | `references/portfolio/INSTRUCTIONS.md` | `references/portfolio/wix-portfolio.js` |
| Restaurant: menu, online ordering, table reservations | **restaurants** | `references/restaurants/INSTRUCTIONS.md` | `wix-restaurants-menu.js` (always) + `wix-restaurants-ordering.js` + `wix-restaurants-reservations.js` as needed |
| CMS content: list/detail, filter/search, forms, data CRUD | **cms** | `references/cms/INSTRUCTIONS.md` | `references/cms/wix-cms.js` |
| Plans & pricing: memberships/subscriptions, subscribe, my plans | **pricing-plans** | `references/pricing-plans/INSTRUCTIONS.md` | `references/pricing-plans/wix-pricing-plans.js` |

## The run

1. **Get `WIX_CLIENT_ID`.** It comes from the user (the handoff prompt from their Wix/vibe
   platform carries it). If it's missing, ask for it before wiring — nothing works without it.
2. **Pick the vertical(s)** from the routing table and open each one's `INSTRUCTIONS.md`.
3. **Copy the two files per vertical** — `shared/wix-client.js` (once) + the vertical helper —
   into the app's `src/rest/` (adjust only the import path if the app uses a different folder),
   and set `WIX_CLIENT_ID`.
4. **Wire the UI** to the exported helpers following the vertical's INSTRUCTIONS. Build the UI
   however the project wants — these scaffolds ship the REST layer only, no components.
5. **Verify** against the vertical's checklist before declaring done: token persists across
   reload, live data renders (or a real empty state), and purchases go through the Wix redirect.

> Some flows need Wix-side setup the user completes later (payments connected, the deployed
> domain allow-listed on the OAuth client for hosted-checkout return, collection permissions).
> Those are out of scope here — if a call fails for that reason, flag it and continue; don't
> fall back to mock data.
