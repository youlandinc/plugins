# Wix CMS Skill

> **Source files (in this skill):** the shared transport `references/shared/wix-client.js` and this vertical's `references/cms/wix-cms.js`. Copy **both** into your app's `src/rest/` side by side — the helper does `import { wixApiRequest } from "./wix-client.js"`, so they must land in the same folder.

Builds a real, client-only Wix CMS-backed app. The browser talks to Wix Data directly
over a public `WIX_CLIENT_ID` to read and write items in the site's data collections.
Never mock data; never hand-build API URLs — always go through the helpers, which call
the official Wix Data endpoints.

## When to use
- User wants to display Wix CMS / Content Manager content (a collection of posts,
  tutorials, recipes, team members, listings, FAQs, etc.) on a site.
- Replacing placeholder/mock content with live Wix Data items.
- Adding list pages, detail pages, category/tag filtering, or free-text search over an
  existing Wix data collection.
- Wiring a public form (contact, RSVP, review, signup) that writes a row into a collection.

## Prerequisites
1. A Wix site with **a data collection already created and populated** (this skill does
   NOT provision collections — it reads/writes existing ones). The merchant creates
   collections, fields, and items in the Wix dashboard (CMS / Content Manager).
2. The site's public headless **`WIX_CLIENT_ID`**, provided in the handoff prompt (the
   Wix Business Manager surfaces a copyable prompt with the id filled in — see
   the router `SKILL.md`). Paste it into `src/rest/wix-client.js` in place of the placeholder. It is
   a buyer-facing credential (it only mints anonymous visitor tokens), **not** a secret,
   so hardcoding/committing it is fine.
3. **Collection permissions** must match what you're doing. This skill runs as an
   anonymous visitor, so a call only works if the collection grants that action to
   "Anyone": Read for listing content, Insert for a public form. Update/Delete are
   almost always admin- or author-only and will fail for a visitor. The site owner sets
   these in the Wix dashboard (CMS → collection → Permissions). This is a **separate Wix
   setup step the user completes** — out of this skill's scope. If a read/insert fails
   with a permission error (HTTP 403) before that's set, that's expected; flag it and
   continue.
4. You need each collection's **collection ID** (its name, e.g. `Tutorials`) and its
   **field keys** (e.g. `title`, `publishDate`). Read field keys off a fetched item, or
   from the collection schema (see "Beyond the snippets").

## The API (copy as-is; do not re-derive it)
This skill ships only the REST layer — no UI components. Build the UI however the project
wants; wire it to these two snippets. Copy them into the app (e.g. `src/api/`) and only
adjust import paths:
- `src/rest/wix-client.js` — visitor-token mint/refresh + transport. Set `WIX_CLIENT_ID`
  to the id from the prompt (replace the `<YOUR-CLIENT-ID>` placeholder). The visitor
  refresh token is persisted to localStorage; do not re-mint anonymously per load.
- `src/rest/wix-cms.js` — exports:
  - **Read:** `queryDataItems`, `getDataItem`, `getDataItemBy`, `countDataItems`
  - **Write:** `insertDataItem`, `updateDataItem`, `removeDataItem`

The Data Item shape, the per-collection **permissions model**, and the **filter/sort
syntax** are documented as JSDoc comments at the top of `wix-cms.js`. Read them before
building the UI — read helpers return the item's flat `data` payload (which always
includes `_id`), and writes are bound by collection permissions.

## How to wire it (UI is the project's choice)
- **Content list** — `queryDataItems(collectionId, { filter?, sort?, limit?, cursor? })`
  for the listing; render fields directly off each returned item (`item.title`, etc.).
  Pass the returned `nextCursor` back as `cursor` to load the next page. Define
  `filter`/`sort` on the first request only — cursor follow-ups reuse the original query.
- **Detail page** — route by the item's `_id` and call `getDataItem(collectionId, itemId)`;
  returns null on miss → show a not-found state, never invent an item. For human-readable
  URLs, add a slug-like field to the collection and route via
  `getDataItemBy(collectionId, "slug", slugFromUrl)`.
- **Filter & search** — pass a `filter` to `queryDataItems` using the operators documented
  in `wix-cms.js` (`$eq`, `$in`, `$gte`, `$startsWith`, `$hasSome`, `$and`/`$or`, …). For a
  simple text search, `{ title: { $startsWith: term } }`; for richer free-text/fuzzy search
  across fields, see "Beyond the snippets" (Search Data Items).
- **Public form** — on submit, `insertDataItem(collectionId, { name, email, message })`
  (field keys must match the collection). Requires the collection's Insert permission to be
  "Anyone". Show success/failure from the resolved/thrown result; never fake a success.
- **Edit / delete (admin/author flows)** — `updateDataItem(collectionId, itemId, data)`
  (⚠ full replace — fetch + merge first to preserve other fields) and
  `removeDataItem(collectionId, itemId)`. These need Update/Delete granted to the caller,
  which visitors normally don't have — expect them to fail unless the collection is opened up.
- **Empty state** — if `countDataItems(collectionId)` is 0, show an empty state telling
  the user to add items in their Wix dashboard. Never invent items.

## Hard rules (do not violate)
- ✅ Read/write ONLY through the helpers in `wix-cms.js` (which call the official Wix Data
  `/wix-data/v2/items` endpoints).
- ❌ Never hand-build Wix Data URLs or invent endpoint paths.
- ❌ Never mock data — render live Wix Data items or the empty state.
- ❌ Never invent fields, reviews, ratings, or content not present in the collection.
- ✅ Set `WIX_CLIENT_ID` from the prompt's value (public client id — safe to hardcode).
- ✅ Use the item's `_id` as the route key and as `itemId` for get/update/remove.
- ✅ `updateDataItem` REPLACES the whole item — fetch with `getDataItem`, merge your
  changes, then pass the full object, or use Patch Data Item (see below) for partial edits.
- ✅ Treat permission errors (HTTP 403) as a configuration step, not a code bug: tell the
  user which permission to grant in the dashboard. Writes throw on failure — don't swallow
  the error and show a fake success.

## Beyond the snippets
The snippets cover the common CMS paths (list, detail, filter, count, insert, update,
remove). If you hit a use case they don't cover, make the call yourself with
`wixApiRequest` — but look up the exact endpoint, HTTP method, and request body in the
**official Wix API reference** first; never guess:
- CMS / Data Items API reference: https://dev.wix.com/docs/api-reference/business-solutions/cms/data-items.md
- Data Items sample flows: https://dev.wix.com/docs/api-reference/business-solutions/cms/data-items/sample-flows.md
- **Partial update** (change some fields, keep the rest): Patch Data Item —
  https://dev.wix.com/docs/api-reference/business-solutions/cms/data-items/patch-data-item.md
- **Upsert** (insert or update by id): Save Data Item —
  https://dev.wix.com/docs/api-reference/business-solutions/cms/data-items/save-data-item.md
- **Bulk** insert/update/save/remove (many items in one call):
  https://dev.wix.com/docs/api-reference/business-solutions/cms/data-items.md
- **Free-text / fuzzy search** across fields: Search Data Items —
  https://dev.wix.com/docs/api-reference/business-solutions/cms/data-items/search-data-items.md
- **Aggregations** (counts/averages grouped by a field): Aggregate Data Items —
  https://dev.wix.com/docs/api-reference/business-solutions/cms/data-items/aggregate-data-items.md
- **Distinct values** (e.g. all categories for a filter menu): Query Distinct Values —
  https://dev.wix.com/docs/api-reference/business-solutions/cms/data-items/query-distinct-values.md
- **Referenced items** (expand a reference field beyond the inline limit): Query Referenced
  Data Items — https://dev.wix.com/docs/api-reference/business-solutions/cms/data-items/query-referenced-data-items.md
- **Collection schema / field keys & types**: Get Data Collection —
  https://dev.wix.com/docs/api-reference/business-solutions/cms/collection-management/data-collections/get-data-collection.md

Keep the snippets as the default for everything they already do; reach for the API
reference only for the gap.

## Verification checklist (before declaring done)
- [ ] `WIX_CLIENT_ID` set to the prompt's value (not the `<YOUR-CLIENT-ID>` placeholder)
- [ ] Visitor token persists across reload (same anonymous visitor, no re-mint per load)
- [ ] `queryDataItems` returns live items; pagination via `nextCursor` loads more
- [ ] Detail page uses the item's `_id` (or a slug field via `getDataItemBy`) and shows a
      not-found state on miss — no invented item
- [ ] Filter/sort produce the expected subset (operators match the field types)
- [ ] Public form `insertDataItem` succeeds only when Insert is "Anyone"; on a 403 the user
      is told to grant the permission — no fake success
- [ ] Update is treated as a full replace (fetch + merge), so no fields are silently dropped
- [ ] Empty state shown when `countDataItems` is 0
- [ ] No mock data anywhere; no hand-built Wix Data URLs
