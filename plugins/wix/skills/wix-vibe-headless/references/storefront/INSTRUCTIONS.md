# Wix Storefront Skill

> **Source files (in this skill):** the shared transport `references/shared/wix-client.js` and both storefront helpers from `references/storefront/`. All helpers import from `"./wix-client.js"`, so copy them into the same folder (e.g. `src/rest/`). Copy **both** for a full storefront:
>
> | File | What it covers |
> |---|---|
> | `wix-store-catalog.js` | Products, categories, product detail, search |
> | `wix-store-cart.js` | Add to cart, cart management, checkout |

Builds a real, client-only Wix storefront. The browser talks to Wix directly over a
public `WIX_CLIENT_ID`. Never mock products; never hand-build `/checkout` URLs — always
go through the eCom cart + redirect-session.

## When to use
- User wants a Wix eCommerce store or asks to "connect Wix".
- Replacing placeholder/mock products with live Wix data.
- Adding cart, checkout, categories, or product detail pages over an existing Wix Stores catalog.

## Prerequisites
1. A Wix site with **Wix Stores installed and products already added** (this skill does
   NOT provision — it's read-only over the catalog).
2. The site's public headless **`WIX_CLIENT_ID`**, provided in the handoff prompt (the
   Wix Business Manager surfaces a copyable prompt with the id filled in — see
   the router `SKILL.md`). Paste it into `src/rest/wix-client.js` in place of the placeholder. It is a
   buyer-facing credential (it only mints anonymous visitor tokens), **not** a secret, so
   hardcoding/committing it is fine.
3. The deployed app domain must be allow-listed on the OAuth client for Wix-hosted
   checkout to return. This is a **separate Wix setup flow the user completes later** —
   out of this skill's scope. If checkout return fails before that setup is done, that's
   expected; flag it and continue.

## The API (copy as-is; do not re-derive it)
This skill ships only the REST layer — no UI components. Build the storefront's UI
however the project wants; wire it to these two snippets. Copy them into the app (e.g.
`src/api/`) and only adjust import paths:
- `src/rest/wix-client.js` — visitor-token mint/refresh + transport. Set `WIX_CLIENT_ID` to
  the id from the prompt (replace the `<YOUR-CLIENT-ID>` placeholder). The visitor refresh
  token IS the cart identity; it is persisted to localStorage. Do not re-mint anonymously
  per load or the cart silently empties.
- `src/rest/wix-store-catalog.js` — **Catalog:**
  `queryProducts`, `queryProductsByCategory`, `getProductBySlug`, `countProducts`,
  `queryCategories`, `getCategoryBySlug`
- `src/rest/wix-store-cart.js` — **Cart & checkout:**
  `addToCart`, `getCurrentCart`, `updateCartItemQuantity`, `removeFromCart`, `checkout`

The Product and Cart shapes are documented as JSDoc comments at the top of each helper file.
Read them before building the UI — they describe the key fields and link to the full API
reference for anything not shown.

## How to wire it (UI is the project's choice)
- **Product grid** — `queryProducts()` for the listing (visible products only); pass
  `nextCursor` back as `cursor` to load the next page. Render fields directly from the Wix
  product object (see the `Product` typedef in `wix-store.js` for key fields). For price, use
  `actualPriceRange.minValue.formattedAmount` (already includes the currency symbol) — no
  manual formatting needed.
- **PDP** — `getProductBySlug(slug)` keyed off the URL slug; returns null on miss — show
  a not-found state, never invent a product. **Drive the whole PDP from the returned product
  object at runtime — build it generically, not around the one product you happened to inspect.**
  A catalog is heterogeneous: some products have `options`, some have `modifiers` (mandatory or
  optional), some track inventory, some none of these. Render a selector for **every** entry the
  product actually carries: one control per `product.options` (variant choices) **and** one per
  `product.modifiers` (TEXT_CHOICES → choice buttons/select; FREE_TEXT → a text input); render
  neither when the arrays are empty. Skipping modifiers is a common miss — a product with a
  **mandatory** modifier (e.g. "gift wrap?") whose control isn't rendered can never be added: the
  buyer can't satisfy the requirement, so `add-to-cart` returns 200 with an **empty** `lineItems`
  and the add silently no-ops.
- **Gate the Add-to-cart button** — disable it only until the requirements the product *actually
  has* are met, computed from the product object (never assume every product has options or
  modifiers): if `product.options` is non-empty, a variant must resolve from the selections; every
  `modifier.mandatory === true` must have a value. A product with no options and no mandatory
  modifiers is immediately addable — don't leave the button stuck. Optional modifiers never block.
  Then pass the selections to `addToCart` (see Cart below); never call it with a required selection missing.
- **Reflect stock in the UI** — the product object already carries availability at three levels; surface
  it rather than letting the buyer discover it only on click. Read it from the data at runtime (never
  hardcode):
  - **Grid / card:** `product.inventory.availabilityStatus` (`IN_STOCK` / `OUT_OF_STOCK` /
    `PARTIALLY_OUT_OF_STOCK`) — badge an out-of-stock product as sold out.
  - **Option choice:** `product.options[].choicesSettings.choices[].inStock` — disable/strike a choice
    (e.g. size L) that has no in-stock variant, before a full variant is even resolved.
  - **Variant:** `variantsInfo.variants[].inventoryStatus.inStock` — once selections resolve to a
    variant, disable Add-to-cart (label "Out of stock") when that variant is `inStock: false`.
  A product/variant with inventory tracking **off** reports `availabilityStatus: IN_STOCK` /
  `inStock: true` and stays freely addable — tracking-off is not "no data", it's "always available".
  `addToCart` still throws on a sold-out line as a backstop, but the UI should prevent reaching it.
- **Categories** — `queryCategories()` for a category menu; `getCategoryBySlug(slug)` for
  a category landing page. Pass `category.id` to `queryProductsByCategory(categoryId, { limit?, cursor? })`
  to list only the products in that category; paginate exactly like `queryProducts`.
- **Cart** — `addToCart(catalogItemId, variantId?, qty?, { modifierChoices?, customTextFields? }?)`,
  `updateCartItemQuantity(lineItemId, qty)`, `removeFromCart(lineItemId)`.
  - `variantId` (`variantsInfo.variants[].id` from `getProductBySlug`) — required for products with
    options; resolve it by matching the buyer's selections to `variant.choices[].optionChoiceIds`.
  - `modifierChoices` — `{ [modifier.key]: choiceKey }` for `TEXT_CHOICES` modifiers.
  - `customTextFields` — `{ [modifier.freeTextSettings.key]: userInput }` for `FREE_TEXT` modifiers.
    Mandatory modifiers must be included. See the eCommerce integration guide:
    https://dev.wix.com/docs/api-reference/business-solutions/stores/catalog-v3/e-commerce-integration.md
  - Use `cart.lineItems[].id` as `lineItemId` (not `catalogItemId`) for mutations.
  - Read the cart back with `getCurrentCart()` rather than mirroring it locally.
- **Checkout** — `window.location.href = await checkout()`. After the buyer returns from
  hosted checkout the order is placed and the cart is empty — re-fetch with
  `getCurrentCart()` on return (e.g. on mount + `visibilitychange`) to clear the UI.
- **Empty state** — if `countProducts()` is 0, show an empty state telling the user to
  add products in their Wix dashboard. Never invent products.

## Hard rules (do not violate)
- ✅ Checkout ONLY via `checkout()` (`create-checkout` → `/headless/v1/redirect-session`
  `fullUrl`), then redirect.
- ❌ Never hand-build `/checkout`, cart-add, or product permalinks for purchase.
- ❌ Never mock products — render live Wix data or the empty state.
- ❌ Never generate fake reviews, ratings, or testimonials. Empty review UI only.
- ✅ Set `WIX_CLIENT_ID` from the prompt's value (public client id — safe to hardcode).
- ✅ `lineItemId` for cart mutations is `cart.lineItems[].id`, not `catalogItemId`.
- ✅ On the PDP, render a control for **every** `product.options` entry **and** every `product.modifiers`
  entry — never only variants. Keep Add-to-cart disabled until a variant resolves and every
  `modifier.mandatory === true` has a value; a mandatory modifier with no rendered control makes the
  product unbuyable (add-to-cart returns 200 with empty `lineItems`).
- ✅ Pass `addToCart`'s `variantId` (`variantsInfo.variants[].id`) for products with variants; omit for products without.
- ✅ Pass `modifierChoices` (`{ [modifier.key]: choiceKey }`) for TEXT_CHOICES modifiers; pass `customTextFields`
  (`{ [modifier.freeTextSettings.key]: userInput }`) for FREE_TEXT modifiers. Include mandatory modifiers.
- The engine fails loudly on purpose: `addToCart`/`checkout` throw on out-of-stock or
  empty carts. A green path means it is really buyable — don't swallow these.

## Beyond the snippets
The snippets cover the common storefront paths. If you hit a use case they don't cover
(e.g. coupons, members/auth, a product field not shown in the typedef), make the call
yourself with `wixApiRequest` — but look up the exact endpoint, HTTP method, and request
body in the **official Wix API reference** first; never guess:
- Official Wix API reference: https://dev.wix.com/docs/api-reference.md
- eCommerce integration guide (modifiers, custom text, variants): https://dev.wix.com/docs/api-reference/business-solutions/stores/catalog-v3/e-commerce-integration.md

Keep the snippets as the default for everything they already do; reach for the API
reference only for the gap.

## Verification checklist (before declaring done)
- [ ] `WIX_CLIENT_ID` set to the prompt's value (not the `<YOUR-CLIENT-ID>` placeholder)
- [ ] Visitor token persists across reload (cart survives reload, same visitor)
- [ ] Every product choice renders on the PDP — variant options **and** modifiers (mandatory ones included)
- [ ] Add-to-cart button stays disabled until all required choices are made (variant + mandatory modifiers)
- [ ] A product with a mandatory modifier adds successfully (its selection is sent, cart line appears)
- [ ] Stock reflected in the UI — sold-out product badged (grid), out-of-stock option choices and variants disabled/labelled (PDP)
- [ ] Add to cart works; out-of-stock items throw rather than add a dead line
- [ ] Quantity update / remove reflect in `getCurrentCart()`
- [ ] Checkout redirects via redirect-session `fullUrl` (no hand-built URL)
- [ ] Cart re-fetched on return from checkout (clears once the order is placed)
- [ ] Empty state shown when `countProducts()` is 0
- [ ] No mock products anywhere
