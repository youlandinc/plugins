# Wix Pricing Plans Skill

> **Source files (in this skill):** the shared transport `references/shared/wix-client.js` and this vertical's `references/pricing-plans/wix-pricing-plans.js`. Copy **both** into your app's `src/rest/` side by side — the helper does `import { wixApiRequest } from "./wix-client.js"`, so they must land in the same folder.

Builds a real, client-only Wix pricing-plans / membership front end. The browser talks to Wix
directly over a public `WIX_CLIENT_ID`. Never mock plans; never hand-build a `/checkout` or
purchase URL — purchasing always goes through the Wix-hosted **redirect-session** (which also
handles member login and payment).

## When to use
- User wants a "Plans & Pricing", membership, or subscription page on a Wix site.
- User asks to "connect Wix pricing plans" or sell memberships / subscriptions / paid plans.
- Replacing placeholder/mock plans with live Wix data.
- Adding a plan detail page, a buy/subscribe button, or a "my plans" area over existing plans.

## Prerequisites
1. A Wix site with **Pricing Plans installed and at least one plan created** (this skill does
   NOT provision — it's read-only over the plans the merchant added in the dashboard).
2. The site's public headless **`WIX_CLIENT_ID`**, provided in the handoff prompt (the Wix
   Business Manager surfaces a copyable prompt with the id filled in — see the router `SKILL.md`). Paste
   it into `src/rest/wix-client.js` in place of the placeholder. It is a buyer-facing credential
   (it only mints anonymous visitor tokens), **not** a secret, so hardcoding/committing it is fine.
3. **Purchasing a plan is members-only and uses Wix-hosted checkout.** The hosted flow handles
   member login/signup + the order form + payment, then returns to your site. The deployed app
   domain must be allow-listed on the OAuth client for that return to work — this is a **separate
   Wix setup flow the user completes later**, out of this skill's scope. If the return fails
   before that setup is done, that's expected; flag it and continue.
4. To actually charge for paid plans, the site needs a payment method connected and (where
   applicable) tax/business-address configured in the Wix dashboard. Free plans work without this.

## The API (copy as-is; do not re-derive it)
This skill ships only the REST layer — no UI components. Build the page's UI however the project
wants; wire it to these two snippets. Copy them into the app (e.g. `src/api/`) and only adjust
import paths:
- `src/rest/wix-client.js` — visitor-token mint/refresh + transport. Set `WIX_CLIENT_ID` to the
  id from the prompt (replace the `<YOUR-CLIENT-ID>` placeholder). The visitor refresh token is
  persisted to localStorage; after a hosted checkout the same identity returns as a logged-in
  member. Do not re-mint anonymously per load.
- `src/rest/wix-pricing-plans.js` — exports:
  - **Plans:** `queryPlans`, `getPlanById`, `getPlanBySlug`
  - **Purchase:** `checkout`
  - **Member:** `getMyPlanOrders`

The Plan and Order shapes are documented as JSDoc comments at the top of `wix-pricing-plans.js`.
Read them before building the UI — pricing has several models (recurring subscription,
single-payment-for-duration, single-payment-unlimited, free, plus free trials) and the JSDoc
shows exactly how to read price, cycle, and trial for display.

## How to wire it (UI is the project's choice)
- **Plans grid** — `queryPlans()` for the listing (PUBLIC plans only); pass `nextCursor` back as
  `cursor` to load the next page. For each plan render `name`, `description`, `perks[].description`
  as feature bullets, and the price from `pricingVariants[0]` (see the JSDoc "Reading the price"
  notes: `pricingStrategies[0].flatRate.amount` + plan `currency`, plus `billingCycle` for
  recurring and `freeTrialDays` for trials). Show a "Subscribe"/"Buy" button only when
  `plan.buyable` is true.
- **Plan detail** — `getPlanBySlug(slug)` keyed off the URL slug (or `getPlanById(id)`); returns
  null on miss — show a not-found state, never invent a plan. Render perks, the full price/billing
  summary, free-trial note, and `termsAndConditions` if present.
- **Purchase** — `window.location.href = await checkout(planId, { thankYouPageUrl })`. This
  redirects to Wix-hosted checkout, which logs the member in (or signs them up), collects the
  order form, and takes payment. On success Wix returns to `thankYouPageUrl` with a
  `?planOrderId=<GUID>` query param (and `wixMemberLoggedIn`); on abandon/interrupt it returns to
  `postFlowUrl` (defaults to the current page). Never create the order or build the URL yourself.
- **My plans / confirmation** — `getMyPlanOrders()` for the logged-in member's purchases; filter
  with `{ orderStatuses: ["ACTIVE"] }` for current memberships. After returning from checkout,
  re-fetch (e.g. on mount + `visibilitychange`, or when `planOrderId` is in the URL) to show the
  new order. Returns `[]` for anonymous visitors — show a "log in to see your plans" state.
- **Empty state** — if `queryPlans()` returns no plans, show an empty state telling the user to
  create plans in their Wix dashboard. Never invent plans.

## Hard rules (do not violate)
- ✅ Purchase ONLY via `checkout()` (`/headless/v1/redirect-session` with `paidPlansCheckout`),
  then redirect to `redirectSession.fullUrl`.
- ❌ Never hand-build a checkout, purchase, or `/plans-checkout` URL; never call create-order
  directly from the client to "skip" the hosted flow.
- ❌ Never mock plans — render live Wix data or the empty state.
- ❌ Never invent perks, prices, trials, testimonials, or member counts. Render only what the
  plan object returns; empty perks → no feature list.
- ✅ Set `WIX_CLIENT_ID` from the prompt's value (public client id — safe to hardcode).
- ✅ Treat plan objects as display-only — never compute the final charge; Wix settles price, tax,
  proration, and schedule during hosted checkout.
- ✅ Show the buy button only when `plan.buyable` is true; otherwise the plan is merchant-assigned.
- The engine fails loudly on purpose: `checkout()` throws if it can't create the redirect session.
  A green path means it really reached Wix-hosted checkout — don't swallow these.

## Beyond the snippets
The snippets cover the common plans paths. If you hit a use case they don't cover, make the call
yourself with `wixApiRequest` — but look up the exact endpoint, HTTP method, and request body in
the **official Wix API reference** first; never guess:
- Pricing Plans API reference: https://dev.wix.com/docs/api-reference/business-solutions/pricing-plans.md
- Orders (cancel / pause / resume a member's order, price preview): https://dev.wix.com/docs/api-reference/business-solutions/pricing-plans/orders.md
- Headless redirect session (login, logout, other checkouts): https://dev.wix.com/docs/api-reference/business-management/headless/redirects/create-redirect-session.md

Common genuine gaps and where to look:
- **Cancel / pause / resume** a member's subscription → Orders API (`request-cancellation`,
  `pause-order`, `resume-order`). Gate on `plan.buyerCanCancel`.
- **Member login / logout** outside of a purchase → redirect session `login` / `logout` /
  `auth` targets.
- **Coupons / custom start date** at purchase → covered by the hosted checkout; for a fully
  custom flow see Create Online Order in the Orders reference.

Keep the snippets as the default for everything they already do; reach for the API reference only
for the gap.

## Verification checklist (before declaring done)
- [ ] `WIX_CLIENT_ID` set to the prompt's value (not the `<YOUR-CLIENT-ID>` placeholder)
- [ ] Plans list renders live data; price, billing cycle, and free trial read correctly across
      pricing models (recurring, single-payment, free)
- [ ] Plan detail loads by slug and shows a not-found state on a bad slug
- [ ] Buy button shown only for `buyable` plans
- [ ] Purchase redirects via redirect-session `fullUrl` (no hand-built URL) and reaches
      Wix-hosted login + payment
- [ ] On return, the new order appears via `getMyPlanOrders()` (and a "log in" state shows for
      anonymous visitors)
- [ ] Empty state shown when `queryPlans()` returns no plans
- [ ] No mock plans, perks, or prices anywhere
