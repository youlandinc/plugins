# Wix Portfolio Skill

> **Source files (in this skill):** the shared transport `references/shared/wix-client.js` and this vertical's `references/portfolio/wix-portfolio.js`. Copy **both** into your app's `src/rest/` side by side — the helper does `import { wixApiRequest } from "./wix-client.js"`, so they must land in the same folder.

Builds a real, client-only Wix portfolio showcase. The browser talks to Wix directly over a
public `WIX_CLIENT_ID`. Portfolio is **read-only**: never mock projects, never invent media,
and always render live Wix data (or an honest empty state). The content tree is
**Collection → Project → Project Item (image/video)**.

## When to use
- User wants a Wix portfolio / showcase site or asks to "connect Wix Portfolio".
- Replacing placeholder/mock galleries with live Wix Portfolio data.
- Adding a collections gallery, project grids, or a project detail page (media gallery +
  details/links) over an existing Wix Portfolio.

## Prerequisites
1. A Wix site with **Wix Portfolio installed and content already added** — at least one
   collection with projects, and projects with items (this skill does NOT provision; it is
   read-only over the content).
2. The site's public headless **`WIX_CLIENT_ID`**, provided in the handoff prompt (the Wix
   Business Manager surfaces a copyable prompt with the id filled in — see the router `SKILL.md`).
   Paste it into `src/rest/wix-client.js` in place of the placeholder. It is a visitor-facing
   credential (it only mints anonymous visitor tokens), **not** a secret, so
   hardcoding/committing it is fine.
3. If the read calls return `403`/`428` before content is published, the Portfolio app or its
   content may not be live yet. That is a **Wix dashboard setup step the owner completes** —
   out of this skill's scope. Flag it and continue; don't fall back to mock data.

## The API (copy as-is; do not re-derive it)
This skill ships only the REST layer — no UI components. Build the portfolio's UI however the
project wants; wire it to these two snippets. Copy them into the app (e.g. `src/api/`) and only
adjust import paths:
- `src/rest/wix-client.js` — visitor-token mint/refresh + transport. Set `WIX_CLIENT_ID` to the
  id from the prompt (replace the `<YOUR-CLIENT-ID>` placeholder). The visitor refresh token is
  persisted to localStorage; do not re-mint anonymously per load.
- `src/rest/wix-portfolio.js` — exports:
  - **Collections:** `queryCollections`, `getCollectionBySlug`, `countCollections`
  - **Projects:** `queryProjects`, `queryProjectsByCollection`, `getProjectBySlug`, `getProject`
  - **Project items (media):** `listProjectItems`

The Collection, Project, and Project Item shapes are documented as JSDoc comments at the top of
`wix-portfolio.js`. Read them before building the UI — they describe the key fields (cover
image/video, media resolutions, details rows) and link to the full API reference.

## How to wire it (UI is the project's choice)
- **Collections gallery (home)** — `queryCollections()` for the listing (visible collections
  only, in dashboard order); pass `nextCursor` back as `cursor` to load the next page. Render
  `collection.title`, `collection.description`, and `collection.coverImage.imageInfo.url`. Link
  each card to a collection page keyed on `collection.slug`.
- **Collection page** — `getCollectionBySlug(slug)` for the header (returns null on miss — show
  a not-found state, never invent one). Then `queryProjectsByCollection(collection.id, { limit?, cursor? })`
  for its project grid; paginate exactly like `queryCollections`.
- **All-work gallery (optional)** — `queryProjects()` to list every visible project across
  collections (newest-first); paginate the same way.
- **Project grid card** — render `project.title` and the cover: use `project.coverImage.imageInfo.url`
  when present, else the `project.coverVideo.videoInfo.posters[0]` / first
  `coverVideo.videoInfo.resolutions[]` entry. Link each card to a project page keyed on `project.slug`.
- **Project detail page** — `getProjectBySlug(slug)` for the header (title, description, and the
  `details[]` rows: each has a `label` plus either `text` or `link: { text, url, target }`).
  Then `listProjectItems(project.id)` for the media gallery — render IMAGE items from
  `image.imageInfo.url` and VIDEO items from the first `video.videoInfo.resolutions[]` entry
  (with `video.videoInfo.posters[0]` as the poster). Honor each item's optional `link`.
  - If you already hold a project id (not a slug), use `getProject(projectId)` instead.
- **Empty state** — if `countCollections()` is 0, show an empty state telling the user to add
  collections and projects in their Wix dashboard. Never invent projects or media.

## Hard rules (do not violate)
- ✅ Render only live Wix Portfolio data — collections, projects, and items as returned.
- ❌ Never mock projects, collections, or media — render live data or the empty state.
- ❌ Never hand-build Wix Media URLs or page permalinks — use the `url`/`imageInfo.url`/
  `videoInfo.resolutions[].url` fields Wix returns.
- ❌ Never invent project details, captions, dates, or testimonials. Show only what the API returns.
- ❌ Never show `hidden: true` collections or projects to visitors (the helpers already filter
  `hidden` out — don't add them back).
- ✅ Set `WIX_CLIENT_ID` from the prompt's value (public client id — safe to hardcode).
- ✅ Route on `slug` (`getCollectionBySlug` / `getProjectBySlug`); fall back to `getProject(id)`
  only when you hold a GUID.
- The helpers fail soft on read: single fetches return `null` on a miss so you render a
  not-found/empty state rather than a crash — surface that state, don't paper over it with fake data.

## Beyond the snippets
The snippets cover the common portfolio paths. If you hit a use case they don't cover (e.g.
collection SEO tags, project watermark settings, portfolio-wide settings, or filtering by a
field not shown), make the call yourself with `wixApiRequest` — but look up the exact endpoint,
HTTP method, and request body in the **official Wix API reference** first; never guess:
- Wix Portfolio API reference: https://dev.wix.com/docs/api-reference/business-solutions/portfolio.md
- Portfolio Settings (logo, layout, options): https://dev.wix.com/docs/api-reference/business-solutions/portfolio/portfolio-settings/get-portfolio-settings.md
- API query language (filters, sort, paging): https://dev.wix.com/docs/rest/articles/getting-started/api-query-language.md

Keep the snippets as the default for everything they already do; reach for the API reference
only for the gap.

## Verification checklist (before declaring done)
- [ ] `WIX_CLIENT_ID` set to the prompt's value (not the `<YOUR-CLIENT-ID>` placeholder)
- [ ] Visitor token persists across reload (no re-mint storm; reads stay fast)
- [ ] Collections gallery renders live collections with cover images, in dashboard order
- [ ] Clicking a collection lists its projects via `queryProjectsByCollection`
- [ ] Project page renders the project's media gallery from `listProjectItems` (images AND videos)
- [ ] Project `details[]` rows render (text rows and link rows both)
- [ ] Slug routing works; an unknown slug shows a not-found state (no invented project)
- [ ] Hidden collections/projects never appear
- [ ] Empty state shown when `countCollections()` is 0
- [ ] No mock projects, collections, or media anywhere
