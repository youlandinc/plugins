> **Standard call shape for every curl example across these recipes.** The `<AUTH>` placeholder in example curls is shorthand for the `Authorization` header only; body-bearing calls also need `Content-Type: application/json`.

## What Are Management Recipes?

**Management recipes are for REST API operations** that configure, set up, and manage Wix business entities on your site. These recipes use REST API calls and are designed for:

- **Site setup and configuration** — Initial setup of stores, bookings, payments, and other business apps
- **Entity management** — Creating, updating, and deleting products, services, staff members, pricing plans
- **Administrative operations** — Bulk updates, contact labeling, data migrations
- **Backend integrations** — Server-to-server automations, webhooks, data synchronization

These recipes do NOT cover frontend development or SDK usage for displaying data to users.

## eCommerce

**Routing — pick the right entry point:**
- **Any sales/business improvement request** (boost sales, promotions, help my business, holiday deals, improve revenue, discounts, shipping, coupons, clearance) → use [Recommend: eCommerce Strategy](references/ecommerce/recommend-ecommerce-strategy.md). This is the **default entry point** — it analyzes ALL domains (discounts, shipping) and generates cross-domain recommendations. Do NOT ask clarifying questions.
- **Pricing & promotions** (coupons, discount rules, ribbons, sales) → use the [Pricing & Promotions](references/ecommerce/ecom-pricing.md) dispatcher.
- **Shipping setup** (rates, regions, pickup, free shipping, fix coverage) → use the [Shipping](references/ecommerce/ecom-shipping.md) dispatcher.

### [eCommerce: Load Context](references/ecommerce/ecom-load-context.md)
**L1 loader** — loads general site data (siteId, country, currency, industry, catalog analytics) needed by every eCommerce category. Each category dispatcher loads this before tag-matching; runs once per session.

Covers discount strategies (seasonal, upsell, stock mover, bundling) AND shipping optimization (coverage gaps, free shipping, rate strategy, carrier backup). Use this for ANY business improvement request.

### [Pricing & Promotions](references/ecommerce/ecom-pricing.md)
**Dispatcher** — routes coupon/discount/sale/ribbon/bundle requests to the right leaf recipe (create coupon, create discount rule, troubleshoot discount-not-applying), and routes strategic "run a sale / boost sales" requests to `recommend-ecommerce-strategy`.

### [Shipping](references/ecommerce/ecom-shipping.md)
**Dispatcher** — routes shipping-setup requests (rates, regions, pickup, free shipping, fix coverage, optimize rates) to the right leaf recipe. The Shipping Options + Delivery Profiles APIs have no public docs page; `ecom-shipping-api.md` is the authoritative inline reference.
