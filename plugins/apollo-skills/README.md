[![Skills](https://img.shields.io/badge/skills-11-green.svg)](#skills)

A collection of skills for AI coding agents working with Apollo GraphQL tools and technologies.

Apollo Skills follow the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/) format and are available on [skills.sh](https://skills.sh/).

## Installation

Install skills using the [Skills CLI](https://skills.sh/docs/cli):

```bash
npx skills add apollographql/skills
```

The CLI guides you through an interactive installation:

1. **Select skills** - Choose which skills to install
2. **Select agents** - Pick target agents (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Gemini CLI, Goose, OpenCode)
3. **Installation scope** - Project (committed with your code) or Global
4. **Installation method** - Symlink (recommended) or Copy

## Claude Code Plugin

You can also install skills as a [Claude Code plugin](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/discover-plugins):

First, add the marketplace:

```bash
/plugin marketplace add apollographql/skills
```

Then, install the plugin:

```bash
/plugin install apollo-skills@apollo-marketplace
```

Once installed, skills are available as namespaced slash commands:

| Slash Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `/apollo-skills:apollo-client` | Apollo Client 4.x for React — queries, mutations, caching, local state |
| `/apollo-skills:apollo-connectors` | Apollo Connectors — integrate REST APIs into GraphQL |
| `/apollo-skills:apollo-ios` | Apollo iOS — GraphQL client for Swift (iOS, macOS, tvOS, watchOS, visionOS) |
| `/apollo-skills:apollo-kotlin` | Apollo Kotlin — GraphQL client for Android and Kotlin |
| `/apollo-skills:apollo-mcp-server` | Apollo MCP Server — connect AI agents with GraphQL APIs |
| `/apollo-skills:apollo-server` | Apollo Server 4.x — schemas, resolvers, auth, plugins |
| `/apollo-skills:graphql-operations` | GraphQL operations — queries, mutations, fragments |
| `/apollo-skills:graphql-schema` | GraphQL schema design — types, naming, pagination, errors |
| `/apollo-skills:rover` | Rover CLI — schema management and local supergraph development |
| `/apollo-skills:rust-best-practices` | Rust best practices — idiomatic Rust following Apollo conventions |
| `/apollo-skills:skill-creator` | Skill creator — guide for creating new Apollo skills |

## GitHub CLI

You can also install skills with the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) using `gh skill` (preview):

```bash
# Install skills into the current project for Claude Code
gh skill install apollographql/skills --agent claude-code

# Install at user scope (available everywhere)
gh skill install apollographql/skills --agent claude-code --scope user

# Pin to a specific release (skipped during updates so it won't auto-upgrade)
gh skill install apollographql/skills --pin v1.0.0 --agent claude-code

# Preview skills before installing
gh skill preview apollographql/skills
```

`--agent` supports many hosts beyond Claude Code (Cursor, Codex, Gemini CLI, GitHub Copilot, and more); run `gh skill install --help` for the full list.

## Releases

Releases are tagged with semver and published automatically whenever a content change is merged to `main`. The full list lives at [github.com/apollographql/skills/releases](https://github.com/apollographql/skills/releases).

| Install path | What you get |
|---|---|
| `gh skill install apollographql/skills <name>` | Latest tagged release |
| `gh skill install apollographql/skills <name> --pin v1.0.0` | Pinned to a specific release (skipped during updates) |
| `npx skills add apollographql/skills@<name>` | Latest content from `main` (no tag) |
| Claude Code plugin (`claude plugin install`) | Latest plugin version (auto-updates via `claude plugin update`) |

If you need stability, pin via `gh skill install … --pin vX.Y.Z`. Pinned skills are skipped during `gh skill upgrade`, so you upgrade deliberately. For the freshest content, the other paths track `main` HEAD directly.

## Usage

Skills activate automatically once installed. The agent uses them when relevant tasks are detected.

You can also explicitly invoke a skill depending on your tool:

| Tool           | Automatic | Explicit Invocation                                     |
| -------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Claude Code    | Yes       | Slash command (e.g., `/graphql-schema` or `/apollo-skills:graphql-schema` via plugin) |
| GitHub Copilot | Yes       | `/agent` for custom agents, `@github` for GitHub skills |
| Cursor         | Yes       | Rules matched by file patterns (no direct invocation)   |
| Windsurf       | Yes       | Slash command for workflows (e.g., `/workflow-name`)    |

## Skill Structure

Each skill contains:

- `SKILL.md` - Instructions for the agent (required)
- `references/` - Supporting documentation (optional)
