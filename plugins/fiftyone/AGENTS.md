### FiftyOne Troubleshoot (`fiftyone-troubleshoot/`)

**When to use:** User encounters a recurring FiftyOne problem: dataset disappeared, App won't open, changes not saving, MongoDB errors, video codec failures, notebook connectivity issues, missing plugins, or any common pain point.

**Instructions:** Load the skill file at `skills/fiftyone-troubleshoot/SKILL.md`

**CRITICAL safety rules enforced by this skill (except when user gives explicit direction):**
- NEVER delete a dataset without explicit user confirmation
- NEVER directly manipulate MongoDB (no pymongo, no `db.drop_collection`, no raw shell commands)
- NEVER modify FiftyOne config files silently

**Issue Index - categories covered:**
- Dataset persistence (`persistent = True`)
- App connection (`session.wait()`, Windows guard, port conflicts)
- Unsaved changes (`sample.save()`, `dataset.save()`, `set_values()`)
- Video codecs (`reencode_videos()`)
- macOS open files limit (`ulimit -n 65536`)
- Notebook / remote App (`proxy_url`, SSH forwarding)
- MongoDB startup failures (disk space, process restart)
- Missing plugins / operators (`download_plugin`, `enable_plugin`)
- Delegated operator executor errors (launch App first)
- Performance (views, `set_values`, indexes, batching)

**Workflow summary:**
1. Run diagnostic quick-check (version, datasets, fields, plugins)
2. Match symptoms to the issue index table in the skill
3. Explain the cause and proposed fix before applying
4. Apply fix and verify resolution
5. Add new issues to the skill as they are encountered
6. Verify environment status by running a diagnostic check

### FiftyOne Eval Plugin (`fiftyone-eval-plugin/`)

**When to use:** User wants to evaluate a FiftyOne plugin for quality, security, or agent-readiness. Also use when reviewing a community plugin before installation, auditing an existing plugin, or validating a plugin you just built with the develop-plugin skill.

**Instructions:** Load the skill file at `skills/fiftyone-eval-plugin/SKILL.md`

**Key requirements:**
- FiftyOne installed
- FiftyOne MCP server for registration and schema checks
- Access to the plugin source code (local directory)

**Workflow summary (7 phases):**
1. Manifest & Structure — Validate `fiftyone.yml` completeness and file structure
2. Security & Trust — Scan for dangerous patterns (filesystem access, network calls, command execution, env var harvesting, data exfiltration)
3. Registration & MCP — Verify operators register and are exposed as MCP tools
4. Schema & Contract — Check input/output schemas, error handling, validation boundaries
5. Risk Classification — Verify destructive operations are correctly classified as HIGH risk
6. Code Quality — Check FiftyOne conventions, store key scoping, execution patterns
7. Agent Discoverability — Evaluate tool names and descriptions for LLM usability

**Output:** Structured report with overall score (0-100), security assessment (PASS/WARN/FAIL), per-area scores, critical issues, warnings, and actionable recommendations.

**Security weight:** 30% of overall score. FiftyOne plugins run unsandboxed with full filesystem, network, and subprocess access. This skill is the first line of defense for community plugins.

**Related skills:**
- `fiftyone-develop-plugin` (for fixing code quality issues found by eval)
- `fiftyone-code-style` (for fixing style issues found by eval)

### FiftyOne Generate Data Lens Connector (`fiftyone-generate-data-lens-connector/`)

**When to use:** User has an external database schema and wants to generate a Data Lens connector, connect an external data source (PostgreSQL, BigQuery, Databricks, MySQL, SQLite, etc.) to FiftyOne Data Lens, or build a plugin that lets users browse and import data from their database through the FiftyOne App.

**Instructions:** Load the skill file at `skills/fiftyone-generate-data-lens-connector/SKILL.md`

**Note:** Data Lens is a FiftyOne Enterprise feature. The skill will notify OSS users before proceeding.

**Key requirements:**
- FiftyOne Enterprise deployment (Data Lens is enterprise-only)
- Database schema (DDL, column list, or live introspection)
- Database driver package for the target database

**Workflow summary:**
1. Understand the schema (accept DDL, column lists, or introspection output)
2. Identify key columns (filepath, labels, metadata, coordinates)
3. Propose field mapping table for user approval
4. Generate connector plugin (`__init__.py`, `fiftyone.yml`, `requirements.txt`)
5. Validate (syntax check, sample construction, code walkthrough)
6. Iterate on feedback (filters, coordinate normalization, NULLs)

**Reference files:**
- `CONNECTOR-TEMPLATE.md` - Annotated connector code template with adaptation checklist
- `FIELD-MAPPING-GUIDE.md` - Database type to FiftyOne field type mapping rules

**Instructions:** Load the skill file at `skills/fiftyone-issue-triage/SKILL.md`

**Triage categories:**
- Already Fixed - resolved in recent commits
- Won't Fix - by design or out of scope
- Not Reproducible - cannot reproduce with provided info
- No Longer Relevant - outdated version or stale
- Still Valid - confirmed bug or valid feature request

**Workflow summary:**
1. Read issue details and extract key info
2. Search codebase for related code
3. Check git history for fixes
4. Search closed issues/PRs for duplicates
5. Categorize and generate response

### FiftyOne App Playwright (`fiftyone-app-playwright/`)

**When to use:** User wants to drive the FiftyOne App via the Playwright MCP — verify a plugin/operator end-to-end, record a demo or screencast, automate any UI flow against `fo.launch_app(...)`, or debug a session that silently dies after a UI action (the `browser_navigate`-after-`reload_dataset` crash).

**Instructions:** Load the skill file at `skills/fiftyone-app-playwright/SKILL.md`

**Key requirements:**
- FiftyOne installed
- Playwright MCP server connected to the agent
- A live `fo.launch_app(..., remote=True)` session

**Workflow summary:**
1. Launch the App detached with the bundled `scripts/launch_app.py` (trigger-file refresh loop, non-persistent clone with a safe pre-delete guard)
2. Connect Playwright to `http://localhost:<port>`; never `browser_navigate` / `location.reload()` after an operator calls `reload_dataset`
3. Drive the React/MUI UI with `data-cy` selectors, controlled-input setters, and real clicks for comboboxes
4. Refresh after mutations via the trigger file or the `reload_dataset` palette operator
5. Clean up: kill the launcher, drop the non-persistent clone, remove only recent scoped output files

**Bundled scripts:**
- `scripts/launch_app.py` — parameterized launcher implementing the trigger-file refresh loop

### FiftyOne SDK Guidance (`fiftyone-sdk-guidance/`)

**When to use:** User asks how to do something in the FiftyOne Python SDK, asks a docs question, or no operator/skill exists for their goal.

**Instructions:** Load the skill file at `skills/fiftyone-sdk-guidance/SKILL.md`

**Key requirements:**
- *(Optional)* Kapa.ai MCP server connected to the agent, Voxel51's public docs bot at `https://voxel51.mcp.kapa.ai`, OAuth login with your own Google/GitHub account, no API key
- Falls back to training knowledge if not connected
- On Claude Code, the skill offers to connect it automatically (`claude mcp add`) the first time it's needed, pending user confirmation; no manual pre-install step required

**Workflow summary:**
1. Understand the user's SDK goal (direct question or operator fallback)
2. Search live docs with `search_fifty_one_knowledge_sources`, refining the query if needed
3. Build a runnable Python code example from the search results
4. Explain the 1–2 most important methods used
5. Offer follow-up options

## Prerequisites

All skills require:

1. **FiftyOne MCP Server** installed and configured
   - Repository: https://github.com/voxel51/fiftyone-mcp-server
   - Must be running and accessible

2. **FiftyOne** installed
   - Install: `pip install fiftyone`

3. **Required plugins** installed via FiftyOne
   - `@voxel51/brain` - For similarity and duplicates
   - `@voxel51/utils` - For dataset operations

## Integration

Skills work alongside the FiftyOne MCP Server:

- **MCP Server provides tools** - Low-level operations (list_datasets, execute_operator, etc.)
- **Skills provide workflows** - High-level guidance on how to use the tools

When a skill is active, use the FiftyOne MCP server tools to complete the workflow as described in the skill's SKILL.md file.

## General Workflow Pattern

Most FiftyOne skills follow this pattern:

1. Set context with `set_context` tool
2. Launch app with `launch_app` (for delegated operators)
3. Execute operators with `execute_operator`
4. Review results with `get_dataset_summary`
5. Close app with `close_app`

## Important Notes

- Delegated operators (brain, evaluation) require FiftyOne App to be running
- Always call `launch_app()` before using brain operators
- Wait 5-10 seconds after launching app before executing operators
- Close app with `close_app()` when workflow is complete

## Troubleshooting

**"No executor available" error:**
- Solution: Call `launch_app()` and wait for initialization

**"Operator not found" error:**
- Solution: Install and enable the required plugin

**"Context not set" error:**
- Solution: Call `set_context(dataset_name="...")` first

## Session Tracking & Feedback

### WORK_LOG.md

Track session context to help debug issues and provide feedback:

**At START of session:**
- If `WORK_LOG.md` exists: Read it FIRST for project context
- If not: Ask if user wants to create one for tracking

**UPDATE when:**
- Problems solved
- Files created/modified
- Important decisions made
- Commands executed
- At END of substantial interactions

**Template:**
```markdown
# Project Work Log

## Session: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM

### Context
- What we're working on

### Work Completed
- Changes, solutions, files modified

### Commands Executed
```bash
# Commands with results
```

### Decisions Made
- Choices and rationale

### Next Steps
- What remains, blockers

### References
- Relevant docs, links

---
```

**Guidelines:**
- Keep concise - summarize, don't dump conversations
- Reverse chronological (newest first)
- Serves as memory across sessions and context for feedback

### Submitting Feedback

When users want to report issues or provide feedback, **YOU (the agent) must automatically gather and summarize the actual session**:

1. **Summarize the conversation:**
   - What the user was trying to accomplish
   - What steps were taken
   - What went wrong or what feedback they have

2. **Report what was ACTUALLY USED (not all available):**
   - Your agent type (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, etc.)
   - Skills that were invoked/used in THIS session
   - MCP tools that were called in THIS session
   - Read WORK_LOG.md if it exists

3. **Run environment commands:**
   ```bash
   python -c "import fiftyone; print(fiftyone.__version__)"
   pip show fiftyone-mcp-server | grep Version
   python --version
   ```

4. **Generate issue content** with gathered info:
   ```markdown
   ## Feedback

   **Type:** [Bug/Feature/Question]
   **Skill:** [skill that was used]

   ### Session Context
   - **Agent:** [your agent type]
   - **Skills Used:** [only skills invoked in this session]
   - **MCP Tools Used:** [only MCP tools called in this session]

   ### Conversation Summary
   [Summarize what the user was doing and what happened]

   ### Session Log
   [WORK_LOG.md excerpts if available]

   ### Environment
   - FiftyOne: [version]
   - MCP Server: [version]
   - Python: [version]
   ```

5. **Offer to submit directly** or provide content to paste:
   ```bash
   # Submit directly via gh CLI
   gh issue create --repo voxel51/fiftyone-skills \
     --title "[Feedback]: Brief description" \
     --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
   [generated content here]
   EOF
   )"
