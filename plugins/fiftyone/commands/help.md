# FiftyOne Skills Help

This plugin provides expert workflows for building high-quality datasets and computer vision models using [FiftyOne](https://docs.voxel51.com/).

## When to Use This Help

- First time using FiftyOne skills
- Encountering setup or configuration issues
- Want to understand what skills are available

## Prerequisites

Before using FiftyOne skills, ensure the MCP server is installed:

```bash
pip install fiftyone-mcp-server
```

The plugin automatically configures the MCP server connection via `.mcp.json`. If you installed FiftyOne in a virtual environment or conda environment, update the command path in `.mcp.json` to point to your environment's executable:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "fiftyone": {
      "command": "/path/to/your/venv/bin/fiftyone-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```
