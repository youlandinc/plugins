## What are Skills?

Skills are packaged workflows that teach AI assistants to perform complex computer vision tasks autonomously. Combined with the [FiftyOne MCP Server](https://github.com/voxel51/fiftyone-mcp-server), you can find duplicates, run inference, and explore datasets using natural language.

```
"Find and remove duplicate images from my dataset"
"Import this COCO dataset and run object detection"
"Visualize my embeddings and identify outliers"
```

Skills bridge the gap between natural language and FiftyOne's 80+ operators, providing step-by-step guidance that AI assistants follow to complete complex workflows.

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Install Skills

**Universal Installer** (Recommended):
```bash
curl -sL skil.sh | sh -s -- voxel51/fiftyone-skills
```
Interactive prompts let you select skills, agents, and install scope (project or global).

Supported agents: Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, OpenCode, GitHub Copilot, Amp, Antigravity, Roo Code, Kilo Code, Goose

**Claude Code:**
```bash
# Register the skills marketplace
/plugin marketplace add voxel51/fiftyone-skills

# Install a skill
/plugin install fiftyone-find-duplicates@fiftyone-skills
```

**Gemini CLI:**
```bash
gemini extensions install https://github.com/voxel51/fiftyone-skills.git --consent
```

### Step 2: Use It

```
"Write a FiftyOne plugin that displays model confidence"
"Write Python code following FiftyOne conventions"
```

Your AI assistant will automatically load the skill instructions and execute the workflow.

### Step 3: Set Up MCP Server (Optional)

Skills marked with **MCP** in the [table above](#available-skills) require the [FiftyOne MCP Server](https://github.com/voxel51/fiftyone-mcp-server) to interact with datasets and run operators.

```bash
pip install fiftyone-mcp-server
```

> **⚠️ Important:** Make sure to use the same Python environment where you installed the MCP server when configuring your AI tool. If you installed it in a virtual environment or conda environment, you must activate that environment or specify the full path to the executable.

Then configure your AI tool:

<details>
<summary><b>Claude Code</b> (Recommended)</summary>

```bash
claude mcp add fiftyone -- fiftyone-mcp
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Claude Desktop</b></summary>

Edit `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "fiftyone": {
      "command": "fiftyone-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Cursor</b></summary>

[![Install in Cursor](https://cursor.com/deeplink/mcp-install-dark.svg)](cursor://anysphere.cursor-deeplink/mcp/install?name=fiftyone&config=eyJjb21tYW5kIjoiZmlmdHlvbmUtbWNwIn0)

Add to `~/.cursor/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "fiftyone": {
      "command": "fiftyone-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>VSCode</b></summary>

[![Install in VS Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/VS_Code-Install_Server-0098FF?style=flat-square&logo=visualstudiocode&logoColor=white)](https://insiders.vscode.dev/redirect/mcp/install?name=fiftyone&config=%7B%22command%22%3A%22fiftyone-mcp%22%7D)

Add to `.vscode/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "fiftyone": {
      "command": "fiftyone-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

Once configured, you can use MCP-dependent skills:

```
"Find and remove duplicate images from my dataset"
"Import this COCO dataset and run object detection"
```
