## [Unreleased]

## [0.9.0] — 2026-06-28

### Added
- New skill: `/agentforce-secure` — OWASP LLM Top 10 security assessment for live Agentforce agents. Sends 57 adversarial test payloads across 7 categories (Prompt Injection, Sensitive Info Disclosure, Output Handling, Excessive Agency, System Prompt Leakage, Misinformation, Unbounded Consumption) via `sf agent preview`, evaluates all responses via LLM-as-judge (Claude Code), and produces a severity-weighted A–F grade.
- `scripts/security_runner.py` — Reusable test executor: loads YAML payloads, manages preview sessions, sends adversarial utterances, collects responses. No built-in judging — all evaluation done by Claude Code as LLM-as-judge.
- `scripts/security_scoring.py` — Weighted severity scoring calculator (A–F grading).
- `skills/agentforce-secure/assets/payloads/` — 7 YAML payload files with adapted test cases.
- `skills/agentforce-secure/references/` — 5 reference docs (owasp-categories, scoring-methodology, dynamic-test-generation, remediation-guide, troubleshooting).
- Cross-references from `/agentforce-test` (safety verdict section) and agent definitions to the new skill.
- Backward compatibility aliases: `/adlc-security`, `/agentforce-security`, `/owasp-scan`.

- KNOWLEDGE (Knowledge Article Library) and RETRIEVER (Custom Retriever Library) source type support in `data-library-reference.md`, completing all three ADL source types.
- `org-setup-for-adl.md` — fresh org configuration reference (platform settings, admin permsets, Knowledge enablement, agent-user runtime perms, language alignment).
- Anti-hallucination guard instruction fix in `knowledge-grounded.agent` — "ALWAYS call the action FIRST" now precedes the empty-check, preventing planner short-circuit.

### Changed
- **BREAKING** — All four skills renamed from the `{verb}-agentforce` suffix scheme to the `agentforce-{verb}` prefix scheme, aligning with the Salesforce internal `sf-skills` naming convention: `developing-agentforce` → `agentforce-generate`, `testing-agentforce` → `agentforce-test`, `observing-agentforce` → `agentforce-observe`, `securing-agentforce` → `agentforce-secure`. The old names remain registered as backward-compatible aliases (see Migration). The file-copy installer (`tools/install.py`) now matches managed skills by exact name and prunes the legacy directories on upgrade, so existing installs are cleaned up automatically without touching unrelated `agentforce-*` skills.
- `adlc-orchestrator.md` — Added Phase 7 (Security Assessment) and success criterion for Grade B+.
- `adlc-qa.md` — Added `agentforce-secure` to skills list and security assessment workflow section.
- Skill `metadata.version` fields normalized to the `x.y` format required by the Salesforce skill validator (was `x.y.z`) and bumped: `agentforce-generate` 0.7.0→0.8, `agentforce-test` 0.5.1→0.6, `agentforce-observe` 0.5.1→0.6; `agentforce-secure` normalized 0.1.0→0.1.
- Plugin version bumped to 0.9.0 (picks up the new skill versions and the rename).

- All ADL operations now use `sf agent adl` CLI commands exclusively. Removed raw Connect API paths, OpenAPI spec (`adl-api-spec.yaml`), and curl-based Appendix.
- `SKILL.md` ADL orchestration steps updated to reference CLI commands (`sf agent adl list`, `sf agent adl create`, `sf agent adl get`) instead of REST endpoints.
- Permission prerequisites expanded into 4 sub-sections (DC permset, Knowledge FLS, language alignment, Data Space scope) with deploy examples.
- Added "inspect file content" instruction — skill should read the PDF, not ask the user to describe it.

### Removed
- `assets/adl-api-spec.yaml` — 941-line OpenAPI spec replaced by CLI command reference.

### Migration
The four skill commands were renamed. The old names still resolve via aliases, so existing invocations keep working — but new work should use the `agentforce-*` names:

| Old command | New command |
|---|---|
| `/developing-agentforce` | `/agentforce-generate` |
| `/testing-agentforce` | `/agentforce-test` |
| `/observing-agentforce` | `/agentforce-observe` |
| `/securing-agentforce` | `/agentforce-secure` |

**Plugin users** — update to pick up the renamed skills:
```bash
claude plugin update agentforce-adlc@agentforce-adlc
```

**File-copy users** — re-run the installer; it removes the old skill directories and installs the renamed ones automatically:
```bash
python3 ~/.claude/adlc-install.py --update
```

## [0.6.1] — 2026-05-19

### Changed
- `README.md` and `CLAUDE.md` updated to reflect the new plugin slug (`agentforce-adlc`) in install commands, skill namespace examples (`/agentforce-adlc:developing-agentforce`, etc.), and project-structure references.
- `/developing-agentforce` now prompts the user during agent authoring (after Spec approval, before code generation) about whether to ground the agent on a document corpus. If yes, the skill provisions a SFDRIVE Agentforce Data Library via the Einstein Data Libraries REST API and writes the `knowledge:` block + `AnswerQuestionsWithKnowledge` action into the first authored `.agent`. Includes a Data Cloud preflight (`SELECT COUNT() FROM DataKnowledgeSpace` + `GET /einstein/data-libraries` health check) with an A/B branch when DC is not provisioned and a distinct "DC up, ADL service broken" path.
- Skill responsiveness improvements based on the test-agent16 session:
  - ADL readiness now keys on `retrieverId` populating, not the lagging top-level `indexingStatus.status` flag (which can stay `IN_PROGRESS` for 10–30 minutes after the retriever is live).
  - Data Cloud preflight rewritten: primary check is `SELECT COUNT() FROM DataKnowledgeSpace` (the actual ADL pipeline dependency, queryable as soon as DC provisioning completes — pattern adopted from codey-cko2's `setting-up-help-agent`). Secondary check is `GET /einstein/data-libraries` to validate ADL service health. Replaces the prior `DataStream__dlm` query, which produced false-negatives on healthy DC orgs (verified across arc6 / arc2 / arc7).
  - Knowledge-grounded subagent now ships with an anti-hallucination guard: when `knowledgeSummary` is empty, the agent must refuse rather than compose. Also documented in the Wiring section of the Data Library reference.
  - The publish-500 quick-reference is now a four-cause triage (agent-type mismatch, missing `outputs:`, structural drift via diff-against-working-bundle, transient backend) rather than a single-cause hint.
  - New Rule 5 ("Don't stall") in `Rules That Always Apply` codifies that the skill should announce and start the next step automatically rather than waiting for "what's next?" prompts.
- Skill responsiveness improvements based on the test-agent17 session:
  - **ADL provisioning kicks off earlier.** The grounding question (and file-path capture) now lives inside the Design step (Step 1) of the "Create an Agent" workflow, so it gets surfaced during requirements gathering rather than post-Spec-approval. Provisioning starts in Step 3 (environment validation) and runs in the background through bundle generation, code authoring, and validation. By Step 8 (Validate behavior), `retrieverId` has typically populated. Same shape applied to "Modify an Existing Agent" (grounding question moves into Step 2 Update Agent Spec; provisioning kickoff into Step 4).
  - **Pre-publish permset audit added to Step 8 CHECKPOINT.** When the agent has a `knowledge:` block, the skill now verifies the Einstein Agent User has a Data Cloud permset/PSL assigned (one of `GenieDataPlatformStarterPsl` PSL, `GenieUserEnhancedSecurity` PS, `DataCloudUser` PS, or `DataCloudArchitect` PS) before allowing Publish. Without this, `AnswerQuestionsWithKnowledge` returns empty `knowledgeSummary` at runtime and the anti-hallucination guard refuses every utterance — caught by the user in test-agent17 instead of by the skill.
  - **New Step 3b in `agent-user-setup.md`** — discovery-then-assign procedure for the Data Cloud permset, with PSL and PS branches, post-assignment verification queries, and a Data Space scope manual fallback (UI-only — no API exists). The permset name is **not** hardcoded; the skill discovers which name exists in the org. Pattern informed by codey-cko2's `assigning-permission-sets` skill.
  - `data-library-reference.md` now documents the permission prerequisite in the Wiring section, and the "Common pitfalls" list calls out the empty-`knowledgeSummary` symptom for ADL-permission failures.
- `skills/developing-agentforce/assets/` reorganized ([#15](https://github.com/SalesforceAIResearch/agentforce-adlc/pull/15)) — relocated four templates that ARE referenced from `SKILL.md` / `agents/adlc-author.md` into `assets/agents/` so all complete-agent templates live in one place: `template-single-subagent.agent`, `template-multi-subagent.agent`, `local-info-agent-annotated.agent`, `hub-and-spoke.agent`. Updated `SKILL.md`, both READMEs, and `agents/adlc-author.md` to match; fixed a pre-existing stale `multi-topic.agent` reference (actual file is `multi-subagent.agent`). End-state top level is 4 starter files (`adl-api-spec.yaml`, `agent-spec-template.md`, `bundle-meta.xml`, `invocable-apex-template.cls`) plus `agents/` and `patterns/`.

### Added
- This `CHANGELOG.md`, plus a version-and-changelog workflow section in `CLAUDE.md`.
- `skills/developing-agentforce/references/data-library-reference.md` — full ADL provisioning flow (Steps 0–8) and Agent Script wiring guide (`knowledge:` block + `AnswerQuestionsWithKnowledge` action).
- `skills/developing-agentforce/assets/agents/knowledge-grounded.agent` — minimal copy-modify template demonstrating the wiring.
- `skills/developing-agentforce/assets/adl-api-spec.yaml` — ADL OpenAPI spec, used by the optional spec-validation appendix.

### Removed
- `skills/adl/` — folded into `/developing-agentforce`. Users who invoked the standalone skill should now use `/developing-agentforce` for end-to-end agent + ADL authoring.
- `skills/developing-agentforce/assets/` v1 debt ([#15](https://github.com/SalesforceAIResearch/agentforce-adlc/pull/15)) — pruned 9 orphan files and 3 unused subdirectories (`apex/`, `components/`, `metadata/`) left over from the v1→v2 transition. None had live references in `SKILL.md`, reference docs, scripts, or hooks. Removed: `README-legacy.md`, `deterministic-routing.agent`, `escalation-pattern.agent`, `flow-action-lookup.agent`, `minimal-starter.agent`, `prompt-rag-search.agent`, and an older 208-line duplicate of `verification-gate.agent` (the canonical 280-line copy lives under `assets/agents/`).

## [0.6.0] — 2026-05-01

### Changed
- **BREAKING** — Plugin slug renamed from `adlc` to `agentforce-adlc` in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` ([#9](https://github.com/SalesforceAIResearch/agentforce-adlc/pull/9)).

### Migration
Existing users must uninstall the old plugin and install under the new slug:
```bash
claude plugin uninstall adlc@agentforce-adlc
claude plugin install agentforce-adlc@agentforce-adlc
```
Skill invocations change from `/adlc:<skill>` to `/agentforce-adlc:<skill>`.

## [0.5.0] — Initial release

### Added
- Three consolidated skills: `developing-agentforce`, `testing-agentforce`, `observing-agentforce`.
- Four agents: `adlc-orchestrator`, `adlc-author`, `adlc-engineer`, `adlc-qa`.
- PreToolUse / PostToolUse hooks: `guardrails.py`, `agent-validator.py`.
- Discover / scaffold / deploy Python helpers under `scripts/`.
- File-copy installer (`tools/install.py`) for Cursor and legacy Claude Code.
- pytest test suite under `tests/`.
