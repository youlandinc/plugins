# Domino Apps Skill

This skill provides comprehensive knowledge for deploying web applications to Domino Data Lab, with special focus on React applications using Vite.

## Key Concepts

### Domino App Architecture

Domino apps run in containers behind a reverse proxy that:
1. Authenticates users via Domino's auth system
2. Strips the URL prefix before forwarding to your app
3. Routes traffic to your app container
4. Handles infrastructure provisioning, routing, and resource management

**Note:** Port selection is flexible; port 8888 is no longer required. You can use any port your application prefers.

### Critical Configuration Points

1. **Host Binding**: Bind to `0.0.0.0` (not localhost) so Domino can reach your app
2. **Relative Base Path**: Use `base: './'` in Vite config for React apps
3. **app.sh**: Entry point script (launch file) that Domino executes

## Quick Start

### React with Vite

```javascript
// vite.config.js
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  base: './',  // CRITICAL for Domino proxy
  server: { host: '0.0.0.0', port: 8888, strictPort: true },
  preview: { host: '0.0.0.0', port: 8888, strictPort: true },
})
```

```bash
# app.sh
#!/bin/bash
set -e
cd /mnt/code
npm ci
npm run build
npx serve -s dist -l 8888 --no-clipboard
```

### Streamlit

```bash
# app.sh
#!/bin/bash
streamlit run app.py --server.port 8888 --server.address 0.0.0.0
```

### Dash/Flask

```bash
# app.sh
#!/bin/bash
python app.py  # Must bind to 0.0.0.0:8888
```

## Environment Variables

Domino provides these environment variables to your app:

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `DOMINO_PROJECT_NAME` | Current project name |
| `DOMINO_PROJECT_OWNER` | Project owner username |
| `DOMINO_RUN_ID` | Current run identifier |
| `DOMINO_STARTING_USERNAME` | User who started the app |

## Inter-App Communication

Domino apps can communicate with each other using bearer token authentication. This is useful for:
- Calling Model APIs from an app
- App-to-app service calls
- Accessing internal Domino services

### Getting the Access Token

Domino provides an access token service at `localhost:8899`:

```python
import requests

# Get bearer token for inter-app communication
API_TOKEN = requests.get("http://localhost:8899/access-token").text
```

### Making Authenticated Requests

```python
import requests

# 1. Get access token from Domino's token service
API_TOKEN = requests.get("http://localhost:8899/access-token").text

# 2. Set up headers with bearer token
headers = {
    "Authorization": f"Bearer {API_TOKEN}",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}

# 3. Make request to another Domino app or service
payload = {
    "query": "Your request data here"
}

try:
    resp = requests.post(
        "https://your-domino-instance/apps-internal/APP_ID/endpoint",
        json=payload,
        headers=headers,
        timeout=100
    )
    resp.raise_for_status()
    data = resp.json()
    print(data)
except requests.exceptions.RequestException as err:
    print("API call failed:", err)
```

### Key Points

- **Token endpoint**: `http://localhost:8899/access-token` (only accessible from within Domino)
- **Token type**: Bearer token for Authorization header
- **Use cases**: Model API calls, app-to-app communication, internal services
- **Timeout**: Set appropriate timeouts for long-running requests

## API Reference

Before writing or verifying any API call, use the cluster swagger to confirm current endpoint paths and field names. Use public docs for workflow context and field explanations.

### API Version Prioritization Rules

- **Prioritize the Apps v1 API (`/api/apps/v1`)** for all apps creation, update, preview, publication, start and stop workflows. 
- **The Beta API (`/api/apps/beta`) is deprecated** and maintained solely for backward compatibility. Do not build new functionality against `beta` endpoints if a `v1` equivalent exists.
- **Instance Read Operations Exception**: Instance read operations (such as fetching active container logs, `realTimeLogs`, `views`, listing active running instances, or issuing an instance-level `DELETE`) were not migrated to the `v1` spec. They remain active exclusively under the `/api/apps/beta` path. 

*Rule of Thumb:* Use `v1` for automating write or publish actions. Fall back to `beta` for streaming runtime telemetry like logs or views.

**Get the cluster base URL:** `$DOMINO_API_HOST` (injected by Domino into every workspace, job, and app).

Fetch the swagger spec:
```bash
# No authentication required for the public API spec
curl "$DOMINO_API_HOST/assets/public-api.json"
# Browser UI: $DOMINO_API_HOST/assets/lib/swagger-ui/index.html?url=/assets/public-api.json#/
```
