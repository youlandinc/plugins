# Domino Data Lab Plugin for Claude Code

A comprehensive Claude Code plugin providing full coverage of the Domino Data Lab platform for AI-assisted development.

## Overview

This plugin enables Claude Code to help you with all aspects of Domino Data Lab, including:

- **Workspaces**: Jupyter, VS Code, RStudio configuration and management
- **Jobs**: Batch execution, scheduled jobs, and monitoring
- **Environments**: Custom Docker environments and package management
- **Datasets**: Data versioning with snapshots and sharing
- **NetApp Volumes**: Enterprise-grade multi-terabyte storage with near-instant snapshots
- **Apps**: Deploy React, Streamlit, and Dash applications
- **Models**: Deploy, monitor, and manage model endpoints
- **GenAI**: Trace and evaluate AI agents with the Domino SDK
- **Distributed Computing**: Spark, Ray, and Dask clusters
- **And more...**

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Claude Code CLI** v1.0.33 or later (`claude --version` to check)
- Access to a Domino Data Lab instance
- Domino API key (for API operations when running outside a Domino workspace)
- **`uv`** package manager ([install guide](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)) — required for the bundled Domino MCP server

---

### Option 1: Marketplace Install (Recommended)

This approach registers the plugin through Claude Code's native marketplace system so it persists across sessions.

**Step 1: Clone the repository and create a marketplace wrapper**

```bash
# Clone the plugin
git clone https://github.com/dominodatalab/domino-claude-plugin.git

# Create the marketplace directory structure
mkdir -p ~/.claude/marketplaces/domino/.claude-plugin
mkdir -p ~/.claude/marketplaces/domino/plugins

# Move the plugin into the marketplace
mv domino-claude-plugin ~/.claude/marketplaces/domino/plugins/domino-claude-plugin
```

**Step 2: Create the marketplace manifest**

```bash
cat > ~/.claude/marketplaces/domino/.claude-plugin/marketplace.json << 'EOF'
{
  "name": "domino-marketplace",
  "owner": {
    "name": "Domino Data Lab",
    "email": "support@dominodatalab.com"
  },
  "plugins": [
    {
      "name": "domino-claude-plugin",
      "description": "Domino Data Lab plugin for Claude Code - workspaces, jobs, environments, datasets, apps, models, and more",
      "version": "1.0.0",
      "source": "./plugins/domino-claude-plugin",
      "category": "development"
    }
  ]
}
EOF
```

**Step 3: Register the marketplace and install the plugin**

Launch Claude Code and run:

```
/plugin marketplace add /home/<your-username>/.claude/marketplaces/domino
/plugin install domino-claude-plugin@domino-marketplace
```

> **Note:** Replace `<your-username>` with your actual username, or use the full absolute path (e.g., `/home/ubuntu/.claude/marketplaces/domino`). The `~` shorthand may not expand correctly.

**Step 4: Restart Claude Code**

```
/exit
claude
```

The plugin should appear in your loaded plugins on startup. Verify with:

```
/plugin
```

Navigate to the **Installed** tab to confirm `domino-claude-plugin` is listed.

---

### Option 2: Direct Plugin Directory (Development / Quick Start)

Use the `--plugin-dir` flag to load the plugin directly. This is ideal for development, testing, or quick evaluation.

```bash
# Clone the plugin
git clone https://github.com/dominodatalab/domino-claude-plugin.git

# Ensure the plugin manifest exists
mkdir -p domino-claude-plugin/.claude-plugin
cat > domino-claude-plugin/.claude-plugin/plugin.json << 'EOF'
{
  "name": "domino-claude-plugin",
  "description": "Domino Data Lab plugin for Claude Code",
  "version": "1.0.0"
}
EOF

# Run Claude Code with the plugin
claude --plugin-dir ./domino-claude-plugin
```

To make this persistent without the marketplace approach, add a shell alias:

```bash
echo 'alias claude="claude --plugin-dir /path/to/domino-claude-plugin"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

---

### Option 3: Team / Project-Level Install

For teams sharing a project, add the marketplace to your project's `.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "extraKnownMarketplaces": {
    "domino-marketplace": {
      "source": {
        "source": "directory",
        "path": "/path/to/domino-marketplace"
      }
    }
  },
  "enabledPlugins": {
    "domino-claude-plugin@domino-marketplace": true
  }
}
```

When team members trust the repository folder, Claude Code will prompt them to install the marketplace and plugin automatically.

---

## Verifying the Installation

After installation, test that the plugin is working:

1. **Check slash commands are available:**

   ```
   /domino-app-init
   ```

2. **Test skill auto-invocation** by asking a Domino-related question:

   ```
   Help me deploy a Streamlit app to Domino
   ```

   Claude should automatically invoke the `domino-app-deployment` skill.

3. **Check the plugin is listed:**

   ```
   /plugin
   ```

   Navigate to the **Installed** tab.

> **Note:** Plugin skills do not appear in the `/skills` list. They are auto-invoked by Claude based on task context and will show in Claude's init message at the top of a new session.

---

## Updating the Plugin

If installed via the marketplace approach, navigate to the plugin source and pull updates:

```bash
cd ~/.claude/marketplaces/domino/plugins/domino-claude-plugin
git pull
```

Then restart Claude Code. If installed via `--plugin-dir`, pull updates in the cloned directory.

---

## What's Included

### Bundled MCP Server

The plugin includes a vendored copy of the [Domino MCP Server](https://github.com/dominodatalab/domino_mcp_server) that **starts automatically** when the plugin is enabled. It provides tools for running Domino jobs, checking job status/results, and syncing files with DFS-based projects.

- **Inside a Domino workspace:** Fully automatic — authentication uses ephemeral tokens, project info is auto-detected.
- **Outside Domino (laptop):** Set `DOMINO_API_KEY` and `DOMINO_HOST` as environment variables in your shell.

Requires `uv` to be installed (see [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)).

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
| --- | --- |
| `/skills` shows "No skills found" | Plugin skills don't appear in `/skills` — they are auto-invoked by Claude based on context. Check `/plugin` → Installed tab instead. |
| Plugin not loading from settings.json | Claude Code does **not** support a `"plugins"` array in `settings.json`. Use the marketplace approach or `--plugin-dir` flag. |
| `~` path not expanding | Always use absolute paths (e.g., `/home/ubuntu/...`) in marketplace commands and settings. |
| Slash commands not appearing | Restart Claude Code after installing. Commands are loaded at session start. |
| "Failed to parse marketplace file" | Ensure `marketplace.json` has the `owner` object and `source` is a string path (e.g., `"./plugins/domino-claude-plugin"`), not a nested object. |
