# CONVENTIONS.md — Read This Before Writing Anything

You are writing an Agent Skill for Buildkite's CI/CD platform.
Your output will be installed by AI coding agents (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex,
Copilot, Windsurf, Gemini CLI) via `npx skills add buildkite/skills`.

**Read this entire file before writing a single line of your skill.**
**Then review an existing complete skill (e.g. `skills/buildkite-pipelines/SKILL.md`) as your quality benchmark.**

## Kiro Power: Generated, Never Hand-Edited

The repo root is a Kiro power. `POWER.md` + `mcp.json` + `steering/` bundle all skills
together with the Buildkite MCP server. The `steering/` files are **generated** from
`skills/buildkite-*/SKILL.md` by `scripts/build-power.sh`.

- Source of truth: `skills/buildkite-*/SKILL.md` (and their `references/` and `examples/`).
- Generated, do not edit: everything under `steering/`.
- Hand-authored: `POWER.md` (the power manifest) and `mcp.json` (the MCP server config).
- After editing any `SKILL.md`, `./scripts/build-power.sh` must update `steering/`.
- A GitHub Action auto-commits regenerated `steering/` files for same-repository PRs.
- Buildkite enforces this on every PR — a drift between skills and the generated steering files fails the build.

## Skills Are Not Documentation

Skills teach agents *how to do things correctly*. Buildkite docs explain *what features exist*.
Do not rewrite documentation into skill format. Instead, encode the expertise that makes
the difference between a working pipeline and a correct one.

**Content strategy principles:**

1. **Assume the agent is smart.** Do not explain YAML, CI/CD concepts, or general programming.
   Only add context the agent cannot already infer. Challenge every paragraph: does this
   justify its token cost?
2. **Encode expertise, not reference material.** Capture the judgment calls, default
   recommendations, and common mistakes that an experienced Buildkite user knows —
   not exhaustive option lists.
3. **Link to docs, don't duplicate them.** Use the Further Reading section to point at
   canonical Buildkite documentation. One cross-reference is better than a reproduced page.
4. **Test with real usage.** Build evaluations before writing extensive content. Observe what
   agents actually need, not what you assume they need.

## Required: Confirm Your Understanding First

Before writing, state aloud (in your response or thinking):
1. The frontmatter you will use (copy the template below)
2. Your assigned skill name
3. Three topics you will NOT cover (per the boundary table below)
4. Your SKILL.md size target (10-18KB body, with overflow in `references/`)

---

## Skill Directory Structure

Each skill lives in its own directory with this structure:

```
skills/<skill-name>/
├── SKILL.md              (required — core skill, 10-18KB typical)
├── references/           (optional — detailed content loaded on demand)
│   ├── flag-reference.md
│   └── advanced-examples.md
├── examples/             (optional — complete, runnable example files)
├── agents/               (required — multi-agent platform metadata)
│   └── openai.yaml
└── assets/               (required — icon and brand assets for agent marketplaces)
    └── .gitkeep
```

### Agent Platform Metadata

Every skill must include `agents/openai.yaml` for multi-agent platform support.
This metadata controls how the skill appears when installed via `npx skills add`
into agent platforms (OpenAI, Cursor, etc.).

```yaml
interface:
  display_name: "Buildkite <Area>"
  short_description: "<one-line summary matching SKILL.md frontmatter>"
  icon_small: "./assets/buildkite-icon-small.png"
  icon_large: "./assets/buildkite-icon-large.png"
  brand_color: "#00D974"
```

The `assets/` directory holds icon PNGs for marketplace display. Include a
`.gitkeep` until actual icon files are added.

### Progressive Disclosure

Skills use a three-tier loading system to manage context efficiently:

1. **Metadata (name + description)** — always in context (~100 words)
2. **SKILL.md body** — loaded when skill triggers (~1,500-2,500 words)
3. **Bundled resources** — loaded as needed by the agent (unlimited)

SKILL.md should contain the expertise an agent needs for common tasks — recommended
patterns, quick starts, and pitfalls. Move exhaustive flag tables, advanced examples,
edge cases, and deep reference material into `references/` files. These cost zero
tokens until the agent reads them for a specific task.

### What goes where

| Content type | Location | Why |
|-------------|----------|-----|
| Core concepts, quick start, common patterns | `SKILL.md` | Always needed |
| Exhaustive flag tables, advanced YAML examples | `references/` | Loaded on demand |
| Complete runnable pipeline examples | `examples/` | Copy-paste ready |
| Validation or helper scripts | `scripts/` | Executed without reading |

Do not modify other skills. Create only the directories you actually need.

---

## Frontmatter Template

Copy this exactly. Fill in `<skill-name>` and `<description>`:

```yaml
---
name: <skill-name>
description: >
  This skill should be used when the user asks to [primary task verb phrases].
  Also use when the user mentions [specific terms, directories, commands, or concepts].
---
```

**Good description example:**
```yaml
description: >
  This skill should be used when the user asks to "configure pipelines",
  "write pipeline steps", "set up dynamic pipelines", "troubleshoot pipeline syntax",
  or "work with artifacts in pipeline YAML".
  Also use when the user mentions .buildkite/ directory, buildkite-agent pipeline
  upload, pipeline.yml, or asks about Buildkite CI configuration.
```

**Why the description matters:** Agents load skills based on description matching.
A weak description means the skill never gets loaded. Include specific quoted phrases
that match real user queries. Use third person ("This skill should be used when...")
so the system can evaluate the description in context.

---

## Section Order (mandatory)

Every SKILL.md must follow this structure:

1. **YAML frontmatter** (name + description)
2. **H1 title** — `# Buildkite <Area>`
3. **2-sentence overview** — what this covers and why agents care
4. **## Quick Start** — minimum viable example, copy-paste ready, <20 lines
5. **## [Feature sections]** — one H2 per major feature area
   - Include CLI examples in fenced code blocks
   - Include flag tables for the most common commands
   - Include YAML examples where relevant
6. **## Common Mistakes** — table format (see below)
7. **## Additional Resources** — pointers to `references/` and `examples/` files
8. **## Further Reading** — 3-5 links to buildkite.com/docs

---

## Style Rules

**Voice — imperative/infinitive form:**
- Write for agents, not humans. Agents need exact commands and structured data.
- Use imperative form: "Run `bk build create`" not "You should run `bk build create`"
- No second person. Write "Specify the branch with `--branch`" not "You can specify..."
- No marketing language. No "powerful", "seamless", "robust", "best-in-class".
- No hedging. "Use `--branch` to specify the branch" not "You might want to consider using `--branch`..."

**Code blocks:**
- Every code block must be syntactically correct and copy-paste ready
- Use `bash` for shell commands, `yaml` for YAML, `json` for JSON
- Include the full command, not just fragments
- Show realistic example values, not `<your-value-here>` placeholders where avoidable

**Flag tables:**
Use this format for CLI commands. Include the most essential commands inline in
SKILL.md; move exhaustive tables to `references/`.

| Flag | Short | Default | Description |
|------|-------|---------|-------------|
| `--branch` | `-b` | current branch | Git branch to build |
| `--commit` | `-c` | HEAD | Git commit SHA |

The `Short` column is optional — omit it when commands have no short flags.

Always include the Default column. Agents use defaults to fill in omitted arguments.

**YAML examples:**
- Show complete, runnable examples (not snippets missing required fields)
- Add comments explaining non-obvious fields
- Show both minimal and full examples where helpful

**Cross-references:**
When your topic touches another skill's territory, use exactly this pattern:
> For [topic], see the **buildkite-[skill]** skill.

Never duplicate content owned by another skill. One sentence + pointer.

**Size targets:**
- SKILL.md body: **10-18KB** typical. Contains core knowledge for common tasks.
- References: **unlimited**. Move detailed flag tables, advanced examples, and edge cases here.
- Total skill content (SKILL.md + references): **15-45KB** typical.

Note: Anthropic's official guidance recommends skills under ~2,000 tokens / 500 lines.
Our skills are significantly larger because Buildkite-specific domain knowledge is niche
and unlikely to be in model training data. This is a deliberate trade-off — but it means
every line must earn its place. Prefer moving detail to `references/` over inflating SKILL.md.

If your SKILL.md first draft exceeds 18KB, identify sections to extract into `references/`.
If it's under 8KB, it's too thin — expand quick start, add more inline examples, deepen
common mistakes.

---

## Referencing Bundled Resources

When your skill includes `references/`, `examples/`, or `scripts/`, add an
**Additional Resources** section near the end of SKILL.md:

```markdown
## Additional Resources

### Reference Files
- **`references/flag-reference.md`** — Complete flag tables for all commands
- **`references/advanced-examples.md`** — Complex pipeline patterns and edge cases

### Examples
- **`examples/basic-pipeline.yml`** — Minimal working pipeline
- **`examples/matrix-build.yml`** — Matrix build with multiple languages
```

This ensures the agent knows these resources exist and can load them when needed.

---

## Skill Boundary Table

Each skill owns specific topics exclusively. Do not cover topics outside your boundary.

| Topic | Owner | Others do this |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| `pipeline.yml` syntax, step types, plugins, caching, parallelism, retry, `if_changed`, dynamic pipelines, matrix, `notify:`, `artifact_paths:`, concurrency, `agents:` routing, `secrets:` | **buildkite-pipelines** | Reference only |
| Test Engine suites, `bktec` CLI, test splitting, flaky detection, quarantine, test collectors, `BUILDKITE_TEST_ENGINE_*` env vars | **buildkite-test-engine** | Reference only |
| OIDC auth flows, Package Registry setup, SLSA provenance, pipeline signing (JWKS), verification rollout | **buildkite-secure-delivery** | Reference only |
| Clusters, queues, hosted agent instance shapes, cluster secrets, `buildkite-agent.cfg`, agent tokens, lifecycle hooks, pipeline templates, audit logging, SSO/SAML, cost optimization | **buildkite-agent-infrastructure** | Reference only |
| `buildkite-agent` subcommands inside job steps: annotate, artifact, meta-data, pipeline upload, oidc, step, lock, env, secret, redactor, tool sign/verify | **buildkite-agent-runtime** | Reference only |
| `bk build`, `bk job`, `bk pipeline`, `bk pipeline convert`, `bk secret`, `bk artifact`, `bk auth`, `bk cluster`, `bk package` commands | **buildkite-cli** | Reference only |
| REST API endpoints, GraphQL schema/mutations, webhook setup, API authentication, pagination | **buildkite-api** | Reference only |
| CI migration planning, `bk pipeline convert`, provider-specific concept mappings (GitHub Actions, Jenkins, CircleCI, Bitbucket, GitLab CI), pipeline best practices for converted pipelines | **buildkite-migration** | Reference only |

**Artifact ambiguity:** The pipeline YAML for artifact upload/download belongs to
**buildkite-pipelines**. The `buildkite-agent artifact` subcommands belong to
**buildkite-agent-runtime**. The `bk artifact` CLI commands belong to **buildkite-cli**.
Each skill covers its scope and cross-references the others.

## Common Mistakes Table Format

Use this exact format:

```markdown
## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | What happens | Fix |
|---------|-------------|-----|
| ... | ... | ... |
```

Aim for 5-8 rows. These are high-value for agents — they learn what NOT to do, which
is often more useful than what to do.

## Reference

Review existing complete skills to see what good looks like:

- **`skills/buildkite-pipelines/SKILL.md`** — journey skill with progressive disclosure (SKILL.md + references/ + examples/)
- **`skills/buildkite-api/SKILL.md`** — cross-cutting skill, single-file format
- **`skills/buildkite-agent-runtime/SKILL.md`** — cross-cutting skill with reference files

Use these as models for density, structure, and agent-friendliness.
