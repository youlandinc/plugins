# Buildkite Pipelines

Pipeline YAML is the core of Buildkite CI/CD. This skill covers writing, optimizing, and troubleshooting `.buildkite/pipeline.yml` — step types, caching, parallelism, annotations, retry, dynamic pipelines, matrix builds, plugins, notifications, artifacts, and concurrency.

## Quick Start

Create `.buildkite/pipeline.yml` in the repository root:

```yaml
steps:
  - label: ":hammer: Tests"
    command: "npm test"
    artifact_paths: "coverage/**/*"

  - wait

  - label: ":rocket: Deploy"
    command: "scripts/deploy.sh"
    branches: "main"
```

Set the pipeline's initial command in Buildkite to upload this file:

```yaml
steps:
  - label: ":pipeline: Upload"
    command: buildkite-agent pipeline upload
```

The agent reads `.buildkite/pipeline.yml` and uploads the steps to Buildkite for execution.

Buildkite looks for `.buildkite/pipeline.yml` by default. Override the path with `buildkite-agent pipeline upload path/to/other.yml`.

> For agent and queue setup, see the **buildkite-agent-infrastructure** skill.

## Step Types

| Type | Purpose | Minimal syntax |
|------|---------|---------------|
| **command** | Run a shell command | `- command: "make test"` |
| **wait** | Block until all previous steps pass | `- wait` |
| **block** | Pause for manual approval | `- block: ":shipit: Release"` |
| **trigger** | Start a build on another pipeline | `- trigger: "deploy-pipeline"` |
| **group** | Visually group steps (collapsible) | `- group: "Tests"` with nested `steps:` |
| **input** | Collect user input before continuing | `- input: "Release version"` with `fields:` |

For detailed attributes and advanced examples of each step type, see `references/step-types-reference.md`.

## Caching

Caching dependencies is the single highest-impact optimization. Use the cache plugin with manifest-based invalidation:

```yaml
steps:
  - label: ":nodejs: Test"
    command: "npm ci && npm test"
    plugins:
      - cache#v1.8.1:
          paths:
            - "node_modules/"
          manifest: "package-lock.json"
```

The cache key derives from the manifest file hash. When `package-lock.json` changes, the cache rebuilds.

**Hosted agents** also support a built-in `cache` key (no plugin needed):

```yaml
steps:
  - label: ":nodejs: Test"
    command: "npm ci && npm test"
    cache:
      paths:
        - "node_modules/"
      key: "v1-deps-{{ checksum 'package-lock.json' }}"
```

> Hosted agent setup and instance shapes are covered by the **buildkite-agent-infrastructure** skill.

## Fast-Fail and Non-Blocking Steps

Cancel remaining jobs immediately when any job fails:

```yaml
steps:
  - label: ":rspec: Tests"
    command: "bundle exec rspec"
    cancel_on_build_failing: true
```

Use `soft_fail` for steps that should not block the build (security scans, linting, coverage):

```yaml
steps:
  - label: ":shield: Security Scan"
    command: "scripts/security-scan.sh"
    soft_fail:
      - exit_status: 1
```

A soft-failed step shows as a warning in the UI but does not fail the build. Combine with `continue_on_failure: true` on a wait step to let downstream steps run regardless.

## Parallelism and Dependencies

### Parallel execution

Steps at the same level run in parallel by default. Use `parallelism` to fan out a single step:

```yaml
steps:
  - label: ":rspec: Tests %n"
    command: "bundle exec rspec"
    parallelism: 10
```

This creates 10 parallel jobs. Each receives `BUILDKITE_PARALLEL_JOB` (0-9) and `BUILDKITE_PARALLEL_JOB_COUNT` (10) as environment variables for splitting work.

> For intelligent test splitting based on timing data, see the **buildkite-test-engine** skill.

### Explicit dependencies

Use `depends_on` to express step-level dependencies without `wait`:

```yaml
steps:
  - label: "Build"
    key: "build"
    command: "make build"

  - label: "Unit Tests"
    depends_on: "build"
    command: "make test-unit"

  - label: "Integration Tests"
    depends_on: "build"
    command: "make test-integration"
```

Unit and integration tests run in parallel after build completes — no `wait` step needed.

## Annotations

Surface build results directly on the build page using `buildkite-agent annotate`. Supports Markdown and HTML.

```yaml
steps:
  - label: ":test_tube: Tests"
    command: |
      if ! make test 2>&1 | tee test-output.txt; then
        buildkite-agent annotate --style "error" --context "test-failures" < test-output.txt
        exit 1
      fi
      buildkite-agent annotate "All tests passed :white_check_mark:" --style "success" --context "test-results"
```

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--style` | `default` | Visual style: `default`, `info`, `warning`, `error`, `success` |
| `--context` | random | Unique ID — reusing a context replaces the annotation |
| `--append` | `false` | Append to existing annotation with same context |

Link to uploaded artifacts in annotations:

```yaml
- command: |
    buildkite-agent artifact upload "coverage/*"
    buildkite-agent annotate --style "info" 'Coverage: <a href="artifact://coverage/index.html">view report</a>'
```

## Retry

### Automatic retry

Retry transient failures by exit status:

```yaml
steps:
  - label: ":hammer: Build"
    command: "make build"
    retry:
      automatic:
        - exit_status: -1    # Agent lost
          limit: 2
        - exit_status: 143   # SIGTERM (spot instance termination)
          limit: 2
        - exit_status: 255   # Timeout or SSH failure
          limit: 2
        - exit_status: "*"   # Any non-zero exit
          limit: 1
```

### Manual retry

Control whether manual retries are allowed:

```yaml
retry:
  manual:
    allowed: false
    reason: "Deployment steps cannot be retried"
```

For comprehensive exit code tables and retry strategy recommendations, see `references/retry-and-error-codes.md`.

## Dynamic Pipelines

Generate pipeline steps at runtime based on repository state. Upload generated YAML with `buildkite-agent pipeline upload`:

```yaml
steps:
  - label: ":pipeline: Generate"
    command: |
      .buildkite/generate-pipeline.sh | buildkite-agent pipeline upload
```

### When to use what

Pipelines exist on a spectrum. Pick the simplest option that does the job:

| Situation | Approach |
|-----------|----------|
| Same steps every build, branch-level filtering at most | Static YAML |
| Org-wide enforcement of pipeline structure, admin-controlled (Enterprise plan) | Pipeline templates |
| Reusable, vetted logic (caching, Docker, artifact transfer) shared across many pipelines | Pinned plugin |
| Skip steps when specific files haven't changed | `if_changed` |
| Monorepo with separate pipelines per service | `monorepo-diff` plugin |
| Combine `if` and `if_changed` with OR logic | Dynamic generation |
| Apply consistent retry / timeout / env config across many pipelines | Dynamic (shared config) |
| Calculate test shards, matrix combos, `parallelism × matrix` at runtime | Dynamic (often SDK) |
| Monorepo with transitive dependencies between services | Dynamic (custom dep graph) |
| Recover from infra failures (OOM → bigger agent) | Dynamic (`pre-exit` hook) |
| Steps depend on output from previous steps (multi-stage) | Dynamic, often `--replace` or chained uploads |
| Cleanup / teardown step that must run regardless of earlier failures | Dynamic (`pre-exit` uploads a finalizer) |
| Fallback step only when the primary step fails | Dynamic (`pre-exit` checking exit status) |
| Pipeline YAML has outgrown what the team can maintain | Dynamic (SDK in Python / TS / Go / Ruby) |

### Don't reach for dynamic pipelines for the wrong job

Dynamic generation is the right tool when the *steps themselves* need to change. For passing data between steps, simpler primitives exist:

- **`buildkite-agent meta-data set/get`** — small key-value pairs any later step in the same build can read (a version string, a commit SHA, a feature flag).
- **Artifacts** — files passed between steps (`buildkite-agent artifact upload/download`).
- **Trigger step `env:`** — env vars passed to a build in a different pipeline.

If only data needs to move, metadata or artifacts is simpler and safer. See the **buildkite-agent-runtime** skill.

### Bootstrap script

**Always start generator scripts with `set -euo pipefail`.** Without `pipefail`, a failing `pipeline upload` returns the exit code of the last piped command, the build step reports success, and no generated steps appear — the most common dynamic pipeline failure mode.

Example generator that runs tests only for changed services:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -euo pipefail
CHANGED=$(git diff --name-only HEAD~1)
cat <<YAML
steps:
YAML
for dir in services/*/; do
  svc=$(basename "$dir")
  if echo "$CHANGED" | grep -q "^services/$svc/"; then
    cat <<YAML
  - label: ":test_tube: $svc"
    command: "cd services/$svc && make test"
    key: "test-$svc"
YAML
  fi
done
```

Set `key:` on every generated step. It enables `depends_on`, makes retries idempotent (`DuplicateKeyError` blocks silent duplication if the upload step re-runs), and gives stable identifiers across builds. Validate locally with `buildkite-agent pipeline upload --dry-run` before pushing.

Keep uploads under **500 steps per call** and **4,000 jobs per build** (platform defaults, raisable via support). For larger monorepos, use trigger steps to fan out across separate builds.

For type-checked, unit-testable generators, the [Buildkite SDK](https://github.com/buildkite/buildkite-sdk) supports JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, Go, and Ruby. Wrap related steps in group steps once a generator produces more than ~10 steps — adding any group enables DAG mode for the build, and `concurrency` attributes are rejected on groups (see `references/group-steps.md`).

A generator step can also read runtime state (meta-data, artifacts, git diff) and upload the next phase of the pipeline — the handler pattern used by multi-stage builds. For this, fan-out/fan-in, and finalizer / always-run steps via `pre-exit` hooks, see `references/dynamic-pipeline-patterns.md`. For failure modes, see `references/dynamic-pipeline-troubleshooting.md`. For advanced generator patterns (Python, monorepo, multi-stage), see `references/advanced-patterns.md`.

## Conditional Execution

### Step-level conditions

Use `if` to conditionally run steps based on build state:

```yaml
steps:
  - label: ":rocket: Deploy"
    command: "scripts/deploy.sh"
    if: build.branch == "main" && build.message !~ /\[skip deploy\]/
```

For the full list of condition expressions, see [Conditionals](https://buildkite.com/docs/pipelines/configure/conditionals.md).

**`[skip ci]` gotcha:** Buildkite only checks the HEAD commit message for `[skip ci]` / `[ci skip]`. If the tag is in an earlier commit in a multi-commit push, the build still triggers.

### Directory-based step filtering (if_changed)

Skip steps when relevant files haven't changed. Only applied by the Buildkite agent when uploading a pipeline. See https://buildkite.com/docs/pipelines/configure/dynamic-pipelines/if-changed.md.

```yaml
steps:
  - label: ":nodejs: Frontend tests"
    command: "npm test"
    if_changed:
      - "src/frontend/**"
      - "package.json"
```

For exclude patterns and monorepo configurations, see `references/advanced-patterns.md`.

For large monorepos, use the [Sparse Checkout plugin](https://github.com/buildkite-plugins/sparse-checkout-buildkite-plugin) to check out only `.buildkite/` for the upload step — dramatically faster pipeline uploads.

### Conditionally running plugins

Step-level `if` does **not** prevent plugins from executing. Wrap steps in a `group` to skip plugins entirely:

```yaml
steps:
  - group: ":docker: Build"
    if: build.env("DOCKER_PASSWORD") != null
    steps:
      - label: "Build image"
        command: "docker build -t myapp ."
        plugins:
          - docker-login#v2.1.0:
              username: myuser
              password-env: DOCKER_PASSWORD
```

## Matrix Builds

Run the same step across multiple configurations:

```yaml
steps:
  - label: "Test {{matrix.ruby}} on {{matrix.os}}"
    command: "bundle exec rake test"
    matrix:
      setup:
        ruby:
          - "3.2"
          - "3.3"
        os:
          - "ubuntu"
          - "alpine"
      adjustments:
        - with:
            ruby: "3.2"
            os: "alpine"
          skip: true  # Known incompatible
```

Valid properties inside each `adjustments` entry: `with`, `skip`, `soft_fail`, `env`. The `agents:` key is **not valid** inside `adjustments` — Buildkite rejects the pipeline with "agents is not a valid property on the matrix.adjustments configuration". To route matrix combinations to different queues (e.g., Linux vs Windows agents), use separate steps or a dynamic pipeline generator.

## Plugins

Add capabilities with 3-line YAML blocks. Pin versions for reproducibility:

```yaml
plugins:
  - docker-compose#v5.5.0:
      run: app
      config: docker-compose.ci.yml
```

| Plugin | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `cache#v1.8.1` | Dependency caching with manifest-based invalidation |
| `docker#v5.12.0` | Run steps inside a Docker container |
| `docker-compose#v5.5.0` | Build and run with Docker Compose |
| `artifacts#v1.9.4` | Download artifacts between steps |
| `test-collector#v2.0.0` | Upload test results to Test Engine |

Always pin plugin versions (e.g., `docker#v5.12.0` not `docker#v5`). Unpinned versions can break builds when plugins release new major versions.

For **private organizational plugins**, use full Git URLs — the shorthand syntax only works for public plugins:

```yaml
plugins:
  - ssh://git@github.com/my-org/my-plugin.git#v1.0.0:
      config: value
```

## Notifications and Artifacts

Add pipeline-level `notify:` above `steps:` to send Slack, email, or webhook notifications on build state changes. See [Notifications](https://buildkite.com/docs/pipelines/configure/notifications.md) for syntax.

### Artifact upload and download

Upload artifacts from steps, download in later steps:

```yaml
steps:
  - label: "Build"
    command: "make build"
    artifact_paths: "dist/**/*"

  - wait

  - label: "Package"
    command: |
      buildkite-agent artifact download "dist/*" .
      make package
```

When using artifacts in a Docker build, download artifacts before starting the Docker build since `buildkite-agent` is not available inside the container:

```yaml
steps:
  - label: "Docker build"
    command: |
      buildkite-agent artifact download "dist/*" .
      docker build -t myapp .
```

## Concurrency

Limit parallel execution of steps sharing a resource. Always pair `concurrency` with `concurrency_group` — without a group name, the limit is silently ignored.

```yaml
steps:
  - label: ":rocket: Deploy"
    command: "scripts/deploy.sh"
    concurrency: 1
    concurrency_group: "deploy/production"
    concurrency_method: "eager"
```

Use `concurrency_method: "eager"` (next available) for independent jobs like deploys. Use the default `"ordered"` (FIFO) when execution order matters. Set `priority` (default `0`, higher = first) to control which queued jobs run next.

For full concurrency configuration options, see [Controlling Concurrency](https://buildkite.com/docs/pipelines/configure/workflows/controlling-concurrency.md).

> For triggering, watching, and debugging pipelines from the terminal, see the **buildkite-cli** skill.

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | What happens | Fix |
|---------|-------------|-----|
| Missing `wait` between dependent steps | Steps run in parallel, second step fails because first hasn't finished | Add `- wait` or use `depends_on:` |
| Using only `wait` steps for all dependencies | Valid but non-idiomatic; `wait` blocks ALL prior steps, making it impossible to run independent steps in parallel | Give named steps a `key:` and use `depends_on: "key"` to express fine-grained dependencies; reserve `wait` for unconditional barriers |
| No `plugins:` in pipeline for package install steps | Dependencies reinstalled from scratch on every build, slowing builds and inflating costs | Add `cache` plugin (or the built-in `cache:` key for hosted agents) to cache `node_modules/`, `.gradle/`, etc. See the Caching section above |
| Using step-level `if` to skip plugins | Plugins still execute (they run before `if` is evaluated) | Wrap in a `group` with the `if` condition |
| Not pinning plugin versions | Builds break when plugin releases breaking change | Always use full semver: `plugin#v1.2.3` |
| Forgetting `concurrency_group` with `concurrency` | `concurrency` is ignored without a group name | Always pair `concurrency` with `concurrency_group` |
| `artifact_paths` glob doesn't match output | Artifacts silently not uploaded, downstream steps fail | Test glob pattern locally; use `**/*` for nested directories |
| Hardcoding parallel job split logic | Uneven test distribution, one slow job blocks the build | Use `parallelism: N` with timing-based splitting via Test Engine |
| Inline secrets in pipeline YAML | Secrets visible in build logs and Buildkite UI | Use cluster secrets or agent environment hooks |
| Using `retry.automatic` with `exit_status: "*"` and high limit | Genuine bugs retry repeatedly, wasting compute | Target specific exit codes; keep wildcard limit at 1 |
| Using `agents:` inside `matrix.adjustments` | Pipeline upload fails: "agents is not a valid property on the matrix.adjustments configuration" | Remove `agents:` from `adjustments`; use separate steps per platform or a dynamic pipeline generator for per-combination queue routing |
| Build fails but all visible steps passed | A trigger step started a child pipeline that failed, or a step was cancelled rather than unblocked | Check the triggered pipeline's build status; inspect block steps for cancellations |
| Pipeline upload fails with no clear error | YAML syntax error or agent-side issue not shown in build logs | Validate YAML locally; check agent logs on the host machine for detailed upload errors; run `buildkite-agent pipeline upload --debug` |
| Fork builds enabled on public pipelines | Contributors can modify `pipeline.yml` to extract secrets | Disable fork builds in pipeline settings for public repos; use a separate pipeline for external PRs with no secret access |
| Docker Compose steps produce artifacts but agent can't find them | Files created inside containers are invisible to the host agent | Mount the working directory as a volume in `docker-compose.yml` so container outputs are visible for `artifact_paths:` |
| Dynamic pipeline generates 1000+ steps | UI becomes slow, pipeline processing degrades | Keep generated pipelines under ~500 steps; use orchestrator pipelines with trigger steps for larger monorepos |
