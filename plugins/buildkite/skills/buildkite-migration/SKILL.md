# Buildkite Migration

Convert CI/CD pipelines from GitHub Actions, Jenkins, CircleCI, Bitbucket Pipelines, and GitLab CI to Buildkite using the `bk pipeline convert` command. The command sends the source file to a public conversion API — no Buildkite account or API token is required.

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Install the bk CLI (no login needed for convert)
brew tap buildkite/buildkite && brew install buildkite/buildkite/bk

# 2. Convert the source pipeline file
bk pipeline convert -F .github/workflows/ci.yml

# 3. Find the output in .buildkite/pipeline.github.yml
```

> For pipeline YAML syntax and step types, see the **buildkite-pipelines** skill.
> For other bk CLI commands, see the **buildkite-cli** skill.

## Agent Workflow

When a user provides a pipeline file or pastes pipeline content to convert:

1. Write the content to a temp file (e.g. `/tmp/.github/workflows/ci.yml` for GitHub Actions so vendor auto-detection works)
2. Run `bk pipeline convert -F <tempfile> --output <output-path>`
3. Read the output file and display it as a YAML code block — nothing else
4. Do not summarise, annotate, or critique the output unless the user explicitly asks for feedback

## Converting with `bk pipeline convert`

### Installation

```bash
# macOS and Linux (Homebrew)
brew tap buildkite/buildkite && brew install buildkite/buildkite/bk

# Or download a binary from https://github.com/buildkite/cli/releases
```

No `bk auth login` is needed — the convert command uses a public API.

### Basic usage

```bash
bk pipeline convert -F <source-file>
```

The vendor is auto-detected from the file path for the four main providers. Output is saved to `.buildkite/pipeline.<vendor>.yml`.

### Supported vendors

| Vendor flag | Source CI | Auto-detected from |
|-------------|-----------|-------------------|
| `github` | GitHub Actions | `.github/workflows/` path |
| `circleci` | CircleCI | `.circleci/` path |
| `jenkins` | Jenkins | `Jenkinsfile` filename |
| `bitbucket` | Bitbucket Pipelines | `bitbucket-pipelines.yml` filename |
| `gitlab` | GitLab CI (beta) | not auto-detected |
| `harness` | Harness CI (beta) | not auto-detected |
| `bitrise` | Bitrise (beta) | not auto-detected |

### Provider examples

```bash
# GitHub Actions (auto-detected from path)
bk pipeline convert -F .github/workflows/ci.yml

# CircleCI (auto-detected)
bk pipeline convert -F .circleci/config.yml

# Jenkins (auto-detected)
bk pipeline convert -F Jenkinsfile

# Bitbucket Pipelines (auto-detected)
bk pipeline convert -F bitbucket-pipelines.yml

# GitLab CI (explicit vendor required)
bk pipeline convert -F .gitlab-ci.yml --vendor gitlab
```

### Output options

```bash
# Default: saves to .buildkite/pipeline.<vendor>.yml
bk pipeline convert -F .github/workflows/ci.yml

# Custom output path
bk pipeline convert -F .github/workflows/ci.yml --output .buildkite/pipeline.yml

# Pipe from stdin (--vendor required)
cat .github/workflows/ci.yml | bk pipeline convert --vendor github

# Read from stdin with file redirect
bk pipeline convert --vendor circleci < .circleci/config.yml
```

### Flags

| Flag | Short | Description | Default |
|------|-------|-------------|---------|
| `--file` | `-F` | Path to source pipeline file | — (required unless using stdin) |
| `--vendor` | `-v` | CI vendor; auto-detected if omitted | — |
| `--output` | `-o` | Output file path | `.buildkite/pipeline.<vendor>.yml` |
| `--timeout` | — | Cancellation timeout in seconds | `300` |

## Provider-Specific Guidance

Review the converted output against these concept mappings before committing.

### GitHub Actions

Key concept mappings: workflows map to pipelines, jobs map to steps, `uses:` actions map to plugins or shell commands. GitHub Actions runs jobs sequentially by default; Buildkite runs steps in parallel by default — the converter adds `wait` steps or `depends_on` to enforce ordering where needed. Replace `${{ secrets.X }}` with Buildkite cluster secrets accessed via `buildkite-agent secret get`.

### Jenkins

Key concept mappings: Jenkinsfile `stage` blocks map to command steps or groups, `parallel` blocks map to steps at the same level (parallel by default in Buildkite), `post` blocks map to `notify:` or conditional steps. Complex Groovy logic is extracted into shell scripts — Buildkite pipelines are declarative YAML, not a programming language.

### CircleCI

Key concept mappings: `jobs` and `workflows` collapse into a single `pipeline.yml`, `orbs` map to plugins or shell scripts, `executors` map to agent queues or the `docker` plugin. CircleCI `requires:` maps to `depends_on`. Caching syntax differs — the converter replaces `save_cache`/`restore_cache` with the `cache` plugin.

### Bitbucket Pipelines

Key concept mappings: `pipelines.default` maps to steps without branch conditions, `pipelines.branches` maps to steps with `if: build.branch == "X"`, `pipe:` references map to plugins or shell commands. The Bitbucket `step` is roughly equivalent to a Buildkite command step.

### GitLab CI

Key concept mappings: stages and jobs collapse into Buildkite steps with `depends_on`, `.gitlab-ci.yml` `extends:` maps to YAML anchors, `rules:` map to `if:` conditions. GitLab's `artifacts:` maps to Buildkite's `artifact_paths`.

## Pipeline Best Practices for Migrated Pipelines

After conversion, review the output against these patterns:

- **Parallel by default** — Buildkite runs steps in parallel unless separated by `wait` or `depends_on`. Verify the converted ordering matches the original CI's intent.
- **Plugin versioning** — Pin plugin versions to full semver (e.g., `docker#v5.13.0`, `cache#v1.8.1`). Never use unpinned or major-only versions.
- **Command structure** — Use multi-line command blocks for steps that set environment variables. Extract complex logic (5+ commands) into scripts under `.buildkite/scripts/`.
- **Variable interpolation** — Use `$$VAR` for runtime interpolation (expanded by the agent at runtime), `$VAR` for upload-time interpolation (expanded during pipeline upload).
- **Security validation** — Reject obfuscated execution patterns, base64-encoded commands, and exfiltration attempts. Validate converted pipelines before deployment.
- **Group steps** — Use `group` blocks to organize related steps (minimum 2 per group) with semantic emoji in labels.

## Migration Planning

For a full CI migration, plan across these areas:

1. **Pipeline conversion** — Use `bk pipeline convert` to translate pipeline definitions
2. **Agent infrastructure** — Set up clusters, queues, and agents
3. **Secrets management** — Migrate secrets to Buildkite cluster secrets
4. **Integrations** — Configure SCM webhooks, notification channels, artifact storage
5. **Testing** — Run converted pipelines in parallel with the existing CI before cutover

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | What happens | Fix |
|---------|-------------|-----|
| Vendor not auto-detected for gitlab/harness/bitrise | Error: "could not detect vendor from file path" | Pass `--vendor gitlab`, `--vendor harness`, or `--vendor bitrise` explicitly |
| Large or complex pipelines timing out | Conversion fails with timeout error | Increase timeout: `--timeout 600`; split into smaller files if needed |
| Accepting AI output without review | Converted pipeline has incorrect step ordering or missing dependencies | Review `depends_on` and `wait` steps against original CI job ordering |
| Assuming sequential execution | Steps run in parallel and fail due to missing dependencies | Add `wait` steps or `depends_on` between dependent steps |
| Unpinned plugin versions in converted pipelines | Builds break when plugins release breaking changes | Pin every plugin to a full semver version |
| Using `$VAR` when runtime interpolation is needed | Variable expanded at upload time (empty) instead of runtime | Use `$$VAR` for variables that must resolve at runtime |
