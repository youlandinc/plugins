# Buildkite Skills

The official Buildkite skills for Claude Code, Cursor, and other AI coding
agents. Install them into your agent of choice so it can generate correct
pipeline YAML, run `bk` and `buildkite-agent` CLI commands, call the API,
configure agents, and run preflight builds.

## Installation

```bash
npx skills add buildkite/skills
```

See [skills.sh](https://skills.sh) for supported agents and options.

### Cursor

Search for **Buildkite Skills** in the Cursor Marketplace, or run `/add-plugin` and search for "Buildkite".

### Kiro

Recommended (one install): add the Buildkite **power** in the Powers panel, pointing at
`github.com/buildkite/skills`. The root `POWER.md`, `mcp.json`, and `steering/`
together give Kiro the Buildkite MCP server plus all six workflows (pipelines,
migration, preflight, agent-runtime, CLI, API), loaded automatically when relevant.

Alternatively, install individual workflows as Kiro **skills** via the Skills panel —
each `skills/buildkite-*/` directory already conforms to the open Agent Skills standard.

### Manual

Copy skill directories into your agent's skills folder:

```bash
# Claude Code
mkdir -p .claude/skills
cp -r skills/buildkite-pipelines .claude/skills/
cp -r skills/buildkite-preflight .claude/skills/
cp -r skills/buildkite-agent-runtime .claude/skills/
cp -r skills/buildkite-cli .claude/skills/
cp -r skills/buildkite-api .claude/skills/
cp -r skills/buildkite-migration .claude/skills/

# Cursor
mkdir -p .cursor/skills
cp -r skills/buildkite-pipelines .cursor/skills/
cp -r skills/buildkite-preflight .cursor/skills/
cp -r skills/buildkite-agent-runtime .cursor/skills/
cp -r skills/buildkite-cli .cursor/skills/
cp -r skills/buildkite-api .cursor/skills/
cp -r skills/buildkite-migration .cursor/skills/
```

## Skills

### Journey Skills

Skills organized by what you are trying to accomplish.

| Skill | Directory | Description |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| **Pipelines** | [skills/buildkite-pipelines/](skills/buildkite-pipelines/SKILL.md) | Pipeline YAML, step types, plugins, caching, parallelism, dynamic pipelines, matrix builds, artifacts, hooks |
| **Migration** | [skills/buildkite-migration/](skills/buildkite-migration/SKILL.md) | CI migration planning, converting from GitHub Actions, Jenkins, CircleCI, Bitbucket Pipelines, GitLab CI using `bk pipeline convert` |

### Cross-Cutting Skills

Skills needed across all journeys.

| Skill | Directory | Description |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| **Preflight** | [skills/buildkite-preflight/](skills/buildkite-preflight/SKILL.md) | `bk preflight` runs a CI build against local uncommitted changes |
| **Agent Runtime** | [skills/buildkite-agent-runtime/](skills/buildkite-agent-runtime/SKILL.md) | `buildkite-agent` subcommands inside running job steps — annotate, artifact, meta-data, pipeline upload, OIDC, locks |
| **CLI** | [skills/buildkite-cli/](skills/buildkite-cli/SKILL.md) | `bk` commands for builds, jobs, pipelines, secrets, artifacts, and auth |
| **API** | [skills/buildkite-api/](skills/buildkite-api/SKILL.md) | REST API, GraphQL API, webhooks, authentication, pagination |

## How Skills Differ from Docs

Buildkite docs at [buildkite.com/docs](https://buildkite.com/docs) are the canonical
reference for what Buildkite features exist and how they work.

Skills serve a different purpose: they encode **expertise**. Where docs explain every
option, skills teach agents the right defaults, common patterns, and mistakes to avoid.
A skill captures the judgment an experienced Buildkite user applies — which step type to
reach for, how to structure a dynamic pipeline, when to use OIDC instead of static tokens.

In practice this means:
- Skills assume the agent already understands YAML, CI/CD concepts, and general programming
- SKILL.md files focus on quick starts, recommended patterns, and pitfall tables — not exhaustive option lists
- Detailed reference material lives in `references/` subdirectories, loaded only when needed
- Skills link to Buildkite docs rather than reproducing them

## Contributing

1. Read [CONVENTIONS.md](CONVENTIONS.md) — frontmatter format, section order, style rules, skill boundaries, quality checklist
2. Review an existing complete skill as a quality benchmark (e.g. `skills/buildkite-pipelines/SKILL.md`)
3. Check the boundary table in CONVENTIONS.md — each topic is owned by exactly one skill
4. Write your skill following the section order and style rules
