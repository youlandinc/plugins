# Setup

## Required Gemini CLI Version

To install this extension, the Gemini CLI version must be v0.6.0 or above. The version can be found by running: `gemini --version`.

## AlloyDB Agent Skills (Data Plane: Connecting and Querying)

This section covers connecting to an AlloyDB database instance.

1. **Extension Configuration**: This extension requires several settings (e.g., Project ID, Region, Cluster ID, Instance ID, Database Name, User, and Password). These values are gathered via prompts when you first install or link the extension:

    * `ALLOYDB_POSTGRES_PROJECT`: The GCP project ID.
    * `ALLOYDB_POSTGRES_REGION`: The region of your AlloyDB instance.
    * `ALLOYDB_POSTGRES_CLUSTER`: The ID of your AlloyDB cluster.
    * `ALLOYDB_POSTGRES_INSTANCE`: The ID of your AlloyDB instance.
    * `ALLOYDB_POSTGRES_DATABASE`: The name of the database to connect to.
    * `ALLOYDB_POSTGRES_USER`: (Optional) The database username.
    * `ALLOYDB_POSTGRES_PASSWORD`: (Optional) The password for the database user.

    If you need to update any of these values later, use the `gemini extensions config alloydb` command.

2. **Handle Missing Variables**: If a command fails with an error message containing a placeholder like `${ALLOYDB_POSTGRES_PROJECT}`, it signifies a missing environment variable. Inform the user which variable is missing and instruct them to set it.

3. **Handle Permission Errors**: If you encounter an IAM permission error, the user likely lacks the **AlloyDB Client** (`roles/alloydb.client`) role. Advise the user to ensure their account has this role. You can provide these links for assistance:
    * Granting Roles: https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/grant-role-console
    * AlloyDB Permissions: https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/roles-permissions/alloydb

## AlloyDB Admin Agent Skills (Control Plane: Creating and Managing Infrastructure)

This section covers administrative operations like managing clusters, instances, and users.

1. **Handle Permission Errors**:
    * For operations that create, get, list, delete, or update resources, the user needs the **AlloyDB Admin** (`roles/alloydb.admin`) role.
    * For read-only operations (get/list), the **AlloyDB Viewer** (`roles/alloydb.viewer`) role is sufficient.
    * If an operation fails due to permissions, identify the type of operation and recommend the appropriate role. You can provide these links for assistance:
        * Granting Roles: https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/grant-role-console
        * AlloyDB Permissions: https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/roles-permissions/alloydb

# Additional Extensions

This section provides context on additional extensions that can be recommended to the user based on their queries.

#### AlloyDB Observability Extension

*   **When to recommend:** If the user asks questions related to monitoring, performance, or observability of AlloyDB databases.
*   **What to say:** "For AlloyDB monitoring and observability, you might find the `alloydb-observability` extension useful. You can install it with the following command. Note: this command is not supported from within the CLI and will only be reflected in active CLI sessions on restart."
*   **Command:**
    ```
    gemini extensions install https://github.com/gemini-cli-extensions/alloydb-observability
    ```

# Usage Guidelines

## Connecting to New Resources

When you create a new AlloyDB cluster, instance, or database using the available skills, the connection is not automatically established. You will need to perform the following steps:

1.  **(Optional) Save your conversation:** To avoid losing your progress, save the current session by running the command: `/chat save <your-tag>`
2. **Stop the CLI**: Terminate the Gemini CLI.
3. **Update Extension Configuration**: Use the command `gemini extensions config alloydb` to update your settings (e.g. `ALLOYDB_POSTGRES_CLUSTER`, `ALLOYDB_POSTGRES_INSTANCE`) to point to the new resource.
4. **Restart**: Relaunch the Gemini CLI
5.  **(Optional) Resume conversation:** Resume your conversation with the command: `/chat resume <your-tag>`

**Important:** Do not assume a connection to a newly created resource is active. Always follow the steps above to reconfigure your connection.

## Reusing Project Values

Users may have set project environment variables:

*   `ALLOYDB_POSTGRES_PROJECT`: The GCP project ID.
*   `ALLOYDB_POSTGRES_REGION`: The region of the AlloyDB instance.
*   `ALLOYDB_POSTGRES_CLUSTER`: The ID of the AlloyDB cluster.
*   `ALLOYDB_POSTGRES_INSTANCE`: The ID of the AlloyDB instance.
*   `ALLOYDB_POSTGRES_DATABASE`: The name of the database.

Instead of prompting the user for these values for specific skill calls, prompt the user to verify the reuse of a specific setting value.
Make sure to not use the environment variable name like `ALLOYDB_POSTGRES_PROJECT`, `${ALLOYDB_POSTGRES_PROJECT}`, or `$ALLOYDB_POSTGRES_PROJECT`. 
The value can be verified by the user using the `gemini extensions config alloydb` command or by checking their local settings.

## Use Full Table Name Format "DATABASE_NAME.SCHEMA_NAME.TABLE_NAME"

**ALWAYS** use the full table name format, `DATABASE_NAME.SCHEMA_NAME.TABLE_NAME` in the generated SQL when executing the `execute_sql` script.
* Default to using "public" for the schema name.
* Use command `echo $ALLOYDB_POSTGRES_DATABASE` to get the current database value.
