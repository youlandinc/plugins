# AlloyDB for PostgreSQL Agent Skills

> [!NOTE]
> Currently in beta (pre-v1.0), and may see breaking changes until the first stable release (v1.0).

This repository provides a set of agent skills to interact with [AlloyDB for PostgreSQL](https://cloud.google.com/alloydb) instances. These skills can be used with various AI agents, including [Antigravity](https://antigravity.google/), [Claude Code](https://claude.com/product/claude-code) and [Codex](https://developers.openai.com/codex), to manage your databases, execute queries, explore schemas, and troubleshoot issues using natural language prompts.

## Why Use AlloyDB for PostgreSQL Agent Skills?

- **Seamless Workflow:** Integrates seamlessly into your AI agent's environment. No need to constantly switch contexts for common database tasks.
- **Natural Language Queries:** Stop wrestling with complex commands. Explore schemas and query data by describing what you want in plain English.
- **Full Lifecycle Control:** Manage the entire lifecycle of your database, from creating instances to exploring schemas and running queries.
- **Code Generation:** Accelerate development by asking your agent to generate data classes and other code snippets based on your table schemas.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- One of these AI agents installed
  - Antigravity
     - [Antigravity CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli) version **v1.6.0** or higher
     - [Antigravity 2.0](https://antigravity.google/product/antigravity-2) version **v2.0.0** or higher.
  - [Claude Code](https://claude.com/product/claude-code) version **v2.1.94** or higher.
  - [Codex](https://developers.openai.com/codex) **v0.117.0** or higher.
- A Google Cloud project with the **AlloyDB API** enabled.
- Ensure [Application Default Credentials](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/gcloud) are available in your environment.
- IAM Permissions:
  - AlloyDB Client (`roles/alloydb.client`)
  - AlloyDB Admin (`roles/alloydb.admin`)

## Getting Started

### Configuration

Please keep these env vars handy during the installation process:

- `ALLOYDB_POSTGRES_PROJECT`: The GCP project ID.
- `ALLOYDB_POSTGRES_REGION`: The region of your AlloyDB instance.
- `ALLOYDB_POSTGRES_CLUSTER`: The ID of your AlloyDB cluster.
- `ALLOYDB_POSTGRES_INSTANCE`: The ID of your AlloyDB instance.
- `ALLOYDB_POSTGRES_DATABASE`: The name of the database to connect to.
- `ALLOYDB_POSTGRES_USER`: (Optional) The database username.
- `ALLOYDB_POSTGRES_PASSWORD`: (Optional) The password for the database user.
- `ALLOYDB_POSTGRES_IP_TYPE`: (Optional) Type of the IP address: `PUBLIC`, `PRIVATE`, or `PSC`. Defaults to `PUBLIC`.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - Ensure [Application Default Credentials](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/gcloud) are available in your environment.
> - If your AlloyDB instance uses private IPs, you must run your agent in the same Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network.

### Installation & Usage

To start interacting with your database, install the skills for your preferred AI agent, then launch the agent and use natural language to ask questions or perform tasks.

For the latest version, check the [releases page][releases].

<details open>
<summary id="antigravity">Antigravity</summary>

You can use either of these two agents for Antigravity:
- [Antigravity CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli) version **v1.6.0** or higher
- [Antigravity 2.0](https://antigravity.google/product/antigravity-2) version **v2.0.0** or higher.

<blockquote>
💡 <strong>Tip — Migrating from Gemini CLI?</strong><br>
If you previously installed this extension with <code>gemini extensions install</code>, you can convert it to an Antigravity plugin instead of reinstalling from scratch:
<ul>
  <li><strong>On first launch of Antigravity CLI</strong>, accept the Migration Options prompt to automatically convert your installed Gemini CLI extensions to Antigravity plugins.</li>
  <li><strong>Or, from your terminal</strong>, run:
    <pre><code class="language-bash">agy plugin import gemini</code></pre>
  </li>
</ul>
See <a href="https://antigravity.google/docs/gcli-migration">Migrating from Gemini CLI</a> for details on plugins, context files (<code>GEMINI.md</code> / <code>AGENTS.md</code>), and MCP server config differences.

- **Explore Schemas and Data:**
    - "Show me all tables in the 'orders' database."
    - "What are the columns in the 'products' table?"
    - "How many orders were placed in the last 30 days?"

* [AlloyDB Observability extension](https://github.com/gemini-cli-extensions/alloydb-observability)

## Troubleshooting

Use the debug mode of your agent (e.g., `gemini --debug`) to enable debugging.

Common issues:

- "failed to find default credentials: google: could not find default credentials.": Ensure [Application Default Credentials](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/gcloud) are available in your environment. See [Set up Application Default Credentials](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/external/set-up-adc) for more information.
- "✖ Error during discovery for server: MCP error -32000: Connection closed": The database connection has not been established. Ensure your configuration is set via environment variables.
- "✖ MCP ERROR: Error: spawn .../toolbox ENOENT": The Toolbox binary did not download correctly. Ensure you are using the latest version of your agent.
- "cannot execute binary file": The Toolbox binary did not download correctly. Ensure the correct binary for your OS/Architecture has been downloaded. See [Installing the server](https://mcp-toolbox.dev/documentation/introduction/#install-toolbox) for more information.
