## Skill Routing Table

| User Intent                                                                      | Skill       | Command            |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- | ------------------ |
| **Find or discover entities** (search, browse, filter, list)                     | **Search**  | `/datahub-search`  |
| **Answer a question** about the catalog ("who owns X?", "how many X?")           | **Search**  | `/datahub-search`  |
| **Update metadata** (descriptions, tags, glossary terms, ownership, deprecation) | **Enrich**  | `/datahub-enrich`  |
| **Explore lineage** (upstream, downstream, impact, root cause, dependencies)     | **Lineage** | `/datahub-lineage` |
| **Data quality** (assertions, incidents, health checks)                          | **Quality** | `/datahub-quality` |
| **Notifications** (subscribe to assertion failures, incidents)                   | **Quality** | `/datahub-quality` |
| **Install CLI, authenticate, verify connection**                                 | **Setup**   | `/datahub-setup`   |
| **Configure default scopes and profiles**                                        | **Setup**   | `/datahub-setup`   |

## Disambiguation Rules

When the intent is ambiguous, use these rules:

### "Tag" requests

- **All tag operations** (PII, sensitive, important, reviewed, team-x) → **Enrich** (general metadata)

### "Domain" requests

- **Filter search to a domain** → **Search** (scoped search)
- **Configure default domain** → **Setup** (profile configuration)

### "Quality" or "health" requests

- **Failing assertions, active incidents, health status** → **Quality**
- **Create assertions, run quality checks, raise incidents** → **Quality**
- **Subscribe to assertion failures or incidents** → **Quality**
- **Metadata quality/documentation/ownership coverage** → Use **Search** to gather the data and synthesize the answer

### Lineage vs. Search

- **"What feeds into X" / "what depends on X" / "impact of changing X"** → **Lineage**
- **"What dashboards use table X"** → **Lineage** (relationship traversal)
- **"Who owns X" / "what is X"** → **Search** (metadata lookup)

### Setup vs. other skills

- **"Set up" / "install" / "authenticate" / "verify connection"** → **Setup**
- **"Configure defaults" / "set default platform" / "create profile"** → **Setup**
- **"Check if DataHub is working"** → **Setup** (connectivity verification)

## CLI Attribution

When running `datahub` CLI commands, pass `-C skill=<name>` on the root command so usage can be attributed:

```bash
datahub -C skill=datahub-search search "revenue"
datahub -C skill=datahub-enrich graphql --query '...'
datahub -C skill=datahub-lineage lineage --urn "..."
```

Use the skill name from the YAML frontmatter. If `-C` is not recognized, omit it — the command works the same without it.

## Critical Rules

1. **Never guess the skill.** If the intent is genuinely ambiguous, ask the user to clarify.
2. **One skill per request** unless the user explicitly asks for multiple operations.
3. **Lineage is for lineage only** — not for general "what is this entity?" questions (that's Search).
4. **Search handles ad-hoc questions.** "Who owns X?" and "what columns does X have?" are Search questions, not Lineage.
5. **Enrich handles all metadata writes** — descriptions, tags, glossary terms, ownership, deprecation.
6. **Quality handles data quality** — assertions, incidents, health checks, subscriptions.
7. **Setup handles environment and configuration** — CLI install, auth, connectivity, default scopes.
