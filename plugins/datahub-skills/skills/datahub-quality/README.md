# datahub-quality

Data quality management for DataHub — assertions, incidents, and notification subscriptions.

## What it does

- **Open Source:** Find assets with failing assertions or active incidents, inspect assertion results, check entity health status
- **Cloud (Acryl SaaS):** Create and run assertions (freshness, volume, SQL, field, schema), set up smart/AI-inferred assertions, raise and resolve incidents, configure notification subscriptions via Slack, email, or Teams

## Usage

```
> Check quality of the orders table
> Find datasets with failing assertions
> Create a freshness assertion on my revenue table
> Subscribe me to assertion failures on orders via Slack
> Raise an incident on the customer pipeline
```
