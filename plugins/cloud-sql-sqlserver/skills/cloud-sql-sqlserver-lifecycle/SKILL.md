## Usage

All scripts can be executed using Node.js. Replace `<param_name>` and `<param_value>` with actual values.

**Bash:**
`node <skill_dir>/scripts/<script_name>.js '{"<param_name>": "<param_value>"}'`

**PowerShell:**
`node <skill_dir>/scripts/<script_name>.js '{\"<param_name>\": \"<param_value>\"}'`

Note: The scripts automatically load the environment variables from various .env files. Do not ask the user to set vars unless skill executions fails due to env var absence.

### clone_instance

Clone an existing Cloud SQL instance into a new instance. The clone can be a direct copy of the source instance, or a point-in-time-recovery (PITR) clone from a specific timestamp. The call returns a Cloud SQL Operation object. Call wait_for_operation tool after this, make sure to use multiplier as 4 to poll the opertation status till it is marked DONE.
