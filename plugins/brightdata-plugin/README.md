## Agent Onboarding Skill

The `agent-onboarding` skill is the **entry point** for any coding agent that's new to Bright Data. It runs the install once, walks the human through OAuth, verifies the environment, and then routes the agent to the right narrower skill instead of dumping everything into one place.

### How it works

One install command sets up the CLI, agent skills, and authentication:

```bash
# macOS / Linux
curl -fsSL https://cli.brightdata.com/install.sh | bash

# Cross-platform
npm install -g @brightdata/cli

# Then authenticate once (browser OAuth)
bdata login

# Headless / SSH
bdata login --device
```

`bdata login` saves the API key locally, auto-creates the `cli_unlocker` and `cli_browser` zones, and sets defaults — no token plumbing required.

### Path routing

After install, the skill routes the agent based on the task:

| Situation | Path | Hands off to |
|---|---|---|
| Need web data **during this session** | **A** — live CLI tools | `brightdata-cli`, `search`, `scrape`, `data-feeds`, `competitive-intel`, `seo-audit` |
| Need to **add Bright Data to app code** | **B** — SDK / REST integration | `python-sdk-best-practices`, `bright-data-best-practices`, `scraper-builder` |
| Want a **drop-in tool layer for an LLM agent** | **M** — MCP server | `bright-data-mcp` |
| Need an **API key first** | **C** — auth only | dashboard or `bdata login` |
| Don't want to install anything | **D** — REST API directly | direct calls to `api.brightdata.com` |

### Why this skill matters

Without onboarding, agents either skip auth and crash on the first request, or pick the wrong path (calling REST when the CLI would do, or scraping a site that has a pre-built dataset). This skill makes the first 60 seconds deterministic: install, log in, verify, then hand off.

    }
  }
}
```

### Why This Skill Matters

The `bright-data-mcp` skill ensures Bright Data MCP is **always the default for all web data tasks** — replacing built-in tools like WebFetch and WebSearch with superior alternatives that handle bot detection, CAPTCHAs, and JavaScript rendering automatically.

With this skill:
- **Default web tool** — Claude always uses Bright Data MCP for any web data request, no exceptions
- **Replaces built-in tools** — `search_engine` replaces WebSearch, `scrape_as_markdown` replaces WebFetch
- **Automatic tool selection** — the most specific tool is chosen based on the task
- **Structured data preferred** — `web_data_*` tools used over raw scraping when available
- **Error handling** — built-in fallback strategies and URL validation guidance
- **Workflow orchestration** — multi-step workflows for research, competitive analysis, social monitoring, and lead generation

---

## Competitive Intel Skill

The `competitive-intel` skill turns Bright Data's scraping infrastructure into **real-time competitive intelligence** — replacing $15K–$50K/year enterprise CI tools (Crayon, Klue, AlphaSense) with an AI-native alternative that costs pennies per analysis.

### How it works

The skill combines **live web data** (via `bdata` CLI) with **strategic analysis frameworks** to deliver actionable competitive insights — not stale training knowledge.

Say "analyze my competitor" or "compare pricing" and Claude will:
1. Gather live data using `bdata search`, `bdata scrape`, and `bdata pipelines`
2. Apply the appropriate analytical framework (SWOT, Porter's Five Forces, positioning matrix, etc.)
3. Deliver a structured report with source citations and strategic recommendations

### Analysis modules

| Module | What it does | Data sources |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| **Competitor Snapshot** | Quick profile: positioning, pricing, team, funding, strengths/weaknesses | `bdata scrape` (website), `bdata pipelines` (Crunchbase, LinkedIn) |
| **Pricing Intelligence** | Compare pricing across competitors with positioning analysis | `bdata scrape` (pricing pages), `bdata search` (third-party reviews) |
| **Review Intelligence** | Mine customer reviews for pain points, loved features, and gaps | `bdata scrape` (G2, Capterra), `bdata pipelines` (app stores, Google Maps) |
| **Hiring Signal Analysis** | Infer strategic direction from job postings | `bdata pipelines` (LinkedIn jobs), `bdata scrape` (careers pages) |
| **Content & SEO Battle** | Compare content strategy and search positioning | `bdata search` (SERP rankings), `bdata scrape` (blogs) |
| **Market Landscape Map** | Discover and categorize all players in a market | `bdata search` (discovery), `bdata scrape` (homepages), `bdata pipelines` (Crunchbase) |

### Example usage

```
> Analyze Notion as a competitor. I'm building a PM tool for small teams.

# Claude will:
# 1. Search Google for Notion
# 2. Scrape notion.com, /pricing, /about
# 3. Pull Crunchbase and LinkedIn data
# 4. Deliver a structured Competitor Snapshot with
#    pricing table, messaging analysis, strengths,
#    vulnerabilities, and strategic recommendations
```

```
> Compare pricing between Slack, Teams, and Discord

# Claude will:
# 1. Scrape all three pricing pages
# 2. Normalize into comparison matrix
# 3. Identify pricing models and positioning opportunities
# 4. Deliver a Pricing Intelligence Report
```

## Scraper Builder Skill

The `scraper-builder` skill guides you through building **production-ready web scrapers** for any website. Say "build a scraper for [site]" and Claude will walk you through the entire process.

### How it works

The skill follows a 6-phase workflow:

1. **Understand the target** — What site, what data, what scope?
2. **Check for pre-built scrapers** — Searches 100+ supported domains via the Dataset List API before writing any custom code
3. **Site reconnaissance** — Fetches HTML via Web Unlocker, analyzes rendering (SSR vs CSR), discovers hidden APIs and JSON-LD data
4. **Build the extractor** — Picks the right approach: Web Unlocker + parsing, direct API endpoint, or Browser API with Playwright
5. **Handle pagination** — URL params, next-links, cursor tokens, infinite scroll, load-more buttons, sitemap crawling
6. **Assemble complete scraper** — Runnable script with config, fetcher, parser, paginator, output, and error handling

### API selection logic

| Scenario | API Used |
|----------|----------|
| Site has pre-built scraper (Amazon, LinkedIn, etc.) | Web Scraper API |
| Static HTML, no interaction needed | Web Unlocker |
| Site exposes JSON API internally | Web Unlocker → API endpoint |
| JS-rendered (React, Vue, Angular) | Browser API |
| Infinite scroll / click required | Browser API |
| Search engine results | SERP API |

### Example usage

```
> build a scraper for Amazon product pages, I have 50 ASINs

# Claude will:
# 1. Find Amazon's pre-built scraper
# 2. Use async trigger/poll/fetch for the batch
# 3. Output a complete Python script with structured JSON
```

```
> scrape all job listings from jobs.customsite.com with pagination

# Claude will:
# 1. Check for pre-built scraper (not found)
# 2. Fetch HTML to analyze structure
# 3. Pick Web Unlocker + BeautifulSoup
# 4. Handle pagination automatically
# 5. Output a complete working scraper
```

## Scraper Studio Skill

The `scraper-studio` skill teaches Claude how to use Bright Data's AI-generated scrapers from the terminal — turn a URL + plain-English description into a reusable scraper, then run it against any URL.

### Two commands, one workflow

```bash
# 1. Build a scraper from a natural-language description
bdata scraper create https://example.com/product/1 \
    "Extract title, price, currency, image URL, and availability"

# → prints a collector_id like c_mp3tuab31lswoxvpws

# 2. Run that scraper on any URL
bdata scraper run c_mp3tuab31lswoxvpws https://example.com/product/2 \
    --pretty -o product.json
```

The bridge between the two is `collector_id` — printed by `create`, consumed by `run`. The skill ensures Claude always captures and surfaces it (it's recoverable from every failure path, even partial generations).

### What the skill covers

| Behavior | How it's handled |
|---|---|
| **AI generation flow** | `create` chains `POST /dca/collector` → `POST .../automate_template` → poll `.../automate_template/progress` for `status: "done"`. Typical generation: 5–10 min. |
| **Default run mode** | Async + poll: `POST /dca/trigger_immediate` → poll `/dca/get_result`. Safe for any duration. |
| **`--sync` fast path** | `POST /dca/crawl` for pages expected to finish in < 50 s. On 202 timeout, returns a `response_id` — re-run without `--sync` to pick it up. |
| **`--sync-timeout`** | Bounded to `[25, 50]` seconds. Skill explicitly documents the range. |
| **Auto-fallback to batch** | When a URL expands past the realtime page limit (paginated listings, infinite scroll), the CLI silently falls back to `/dca/trigger` + `/dca/dataset` polling. No flag required. |
| **Failure recovery** | Both `collector_id` and `response_id` are always printed on error — the skill teaches Claude to surface them and resume via the web UI (`https://brightdata.com/cp/scrapers/{collector_id}`) instead of restarting. |
| **Routing rule** | For known platforms (Amazon, LinkedIn, TikTok, etc.) the skill redirects to `data-feeds` — pre-built scrapers are faster, cheaper, and more reliable than building a new one. |

### Description quality matters

The natural-language description is the only signal the AI Flow has. A strong description names every field, disambiguates location (e.g. "the price near the title, not the recommendations sidebar"), handles missing-field cases, and pins types. The skill's `prompts.md` reference has worked strong-vs-weak examples for product pages, listings, and articles.

## Proxy Skill

The `brightdata-proxy` skill generates **working code and configuration** for Bright Data's four proxy networks. It covers usage and integration — choosing the right network, picking an IP pool type, composing the proxy username, and wiring the SSL certificate — but it does **not** walk through control-panel UI setup (the in-app proxy helper is the right surface for that).

### The four networks

| Network | When to use |
|---------|-------------|
| **Datacenter** | Cheapest and fastest. Unprotected targets, public APIs, light scraping, geo-bypass on permissive sites |
| **ISP** | Static IPs that look residential. Long-lived sessions, account management, when IP reputation matters but you want speed |
| **Residential** | Real-user IPs from a 100M+ pool. Default when DC/ISP get blocked; best success rate on hard targets. Requires SSL cert or KYC |
| **Mobile** | 3G/4G/5G carrier IPs. Most expensive — reserve for extreme targets (Instagram, TikTok, some banking) |

For Datacenter and ISP, the skill also helps choose an **IP pool type** — shared pool (pay-per-GB rotating), shared IPs (a leased set shared with others), or dedicated IPs (a set leased exclusively to you).

### Canonical proxy facts

These are easy to get wrong, so the skill anchors on them:

```
host:        brd.superproxy.io
HTTP(S) port: 33335           # paired with the new CA (expires Sept 2034); legacy 22225 is deprecated
SOCKS5 port:  22228
username:    brd-customer-CUSTOMER_ID-zone-ZONE_NAME[-param-value...]
test URL:    https://geo.brdtest.com/mygeo.json   # returns exit IP, country, city, ASN
```

The username carries all per-request config — country/state/city targeting, sticky sessions (`-session-`), dedicated-IP pinning (`-ip-`), DNS resolution, and more — appended with hyphens, not as query-string params. State, city, zip, ASN, OS, and carrier targeting are **Residential/Mobile only**; Datacenter and ISP honor `-country-` only.

### Residential & Mobile SSL access

Residential and Mobile enforce a network-access policy that DC and ISP don't. The skill defaults generated code to loading the **bundled CA** (`assets/brightdata_proxy_ca.crt`) directly in code — no system install, no separate download — and mentions KYC verification and `verify=False` as alternatives.

### Bundled tools

- **`assets/brightdata_proxy_ca.crt`** — the Bright Data Proxy Root CA (port 33335, valid until Sept 2034). Generated code references this path instead of telling the user to download it.
- **`scripts/smoke_test.sh`** — cURL credential smoke test. Hits the geo endpoint through a zone and returns parsed JSON, with distinct exit codes for auth vs HTTP vs network failure.

## Best Practices Skill

The `bright-data-best-practices` skill is a **reference knowledge base** that Claude consults automatically when writing or reviewing Bright Data code. It is not a slash command — it works silently in the background.

### What it covers

| API | Key topics |
|-----|-----------|
| **Web Unlocker** | All request parameters, special headers (`x-unblock-expect`, `x-unblock-data-format`), async flow, billing model, anti-patterns |
| **SERP API** | All Google params (Search, Maps, Trends, Reviews, Lens, Hotels, Flights), Bing params, `brd_json=1` parsed output, async with `x-response-id` |
| **Web Scraper API** | Sync `/scrape` vs async `/trigger`, progress polling, status values, snapshot lifecycle, output formats |
| **Browser API** | Connection strings by framework, session rules, all custom CDP functions (`Captcha.solve`, `Proxy.setLocation`, `Emulation.setDevice`, etc.), bandwidth optimization |

### How it works

The skill has `user-invocable: false` — it never appears in the `/` command menu. Instead, Claude loads its reference material when you ask it to write Bright Data integrations, ensuring generated code uses correct endpoints, real parameter names, and proper patterns.

## Python SDK Best Practices Skill

The `python-sdk-best-practices` skill is a comprehensive guide for writing correct code with the `brightdata-sdk` Python package. Claude consults this automatically when writing, modifying, or reviewing Python code that uses the Bright Data SDK.

### What it covers

| Topic | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Client setup** | Async (`BrightDataClient`) and sync (`SyncBrightDataClient`) clients, context managers, authentication |
| **Platform scrapers** | Amazon, LinkedIn, Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, ChatGPT, TikTok, Reddit — URL-based and keyword search |
| **SERP API** | Google, Bing, Yandex search with location, language, device, and async mode |
| **Datasets API** | 175+ pre-collected datasets with filter, download, sample, and export |
| **Scraper Studio** | Custom scraper execution with trigger/poll/fetch lifecycle |
| **Browser API** | CDP WebSocket URLs for Playwright/Puppeteer automation |
| **Error handling** | Full exception hierarchy with `APIError.status_code`, `APIError.response_text` |
| **Batch operations** | Concurrent scraping with `asyncio.gather()` |
| **Common mistakes** | Forgetting context managers, sync in async, missing `await`, hardcoded tokens |

## JavaScript SDK Best Practices Skill

The `js-sdk-best-practices` skill is a comprehensive guide for writing correct code with the `@brightdata/sdk` JavaScript/TypeScript package. Claude consults this automatically when writing, modifying, or reviewing Node.js/TypeScript code that uses the Bright Data SDK.

### What it covers

| Topic | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Client setup** | `bdclient` (single async client, Node ≥20, ESM+CJS, TS types), `BRIGHTDATA_API_TOKEN`, `await using` / `close()` lifecycle |
| **Web Unlocker** | `client.scrapeUrl(url \| url[], { format, dataFormat, country })` — html/markdown/json/screenshot |
| **Platform scrapers** | 11 platforms (Amazon, LinkedIn, Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, YouTube, Reddit, Pinterest, ChatGPT, Perplexity, DigiKey) — `collect*` / orchestrated / `discover*` method triad |
| **SERP API** | `client.search.google/bing/yandex` (SERP-only — no platform search router in JS) |
| **Discover** | `client.discover(query, { intent })` and `discoverTrigger` for AI-ranked entity/page discovery |
| **Datasets API** | `query → getStatus → download` snapshot lifecycle, camelCase dataset names |
| **Browser API** | `client.browser.getConnectUrl()` CDP URLs for Playwright/Puppeteer/Selenium |
| **Scraper Studio** | `client.scraperStudio.run/trigger/status` for custom collectors |
| **Error handling** | `BRDError` hierarchy (`ValidationError`, `AuthenticationError`, …) |
| **Batch operations** | array inputs and the `*Trigger` + `job.wait()` pattern (not `Promise.all` of blocking calls) |
| **Key differences from Python** | `bdclient` vs `BrightDataClient`, camelCase, SERP-only `search`, no platform search router |

## Discover API Skill

The `discover-api` skill is the foundation for intent-ranked semantic web search with Bright Data's Discover API. It's the building block the `live-research` and `rag-pipeline` skills sit on top of.

### What it covers

| Topic | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Trigger → poll** | Async flow: `POST /discover` → `task_id` → `GET ?task_id=` until `status: "done"` |
| **Surfaces** | REST (`curl`), CLI (`bdata discover`), JS SDK & Python SDK (`client.discover`) — with a per-surface parameter matrix |
| **Parameters** | `query`, `intent`, `num_results` (1–20), `filter_keywords`, `include_content`, `country`/`city`/`language`, date bounds, `format` |
| **Modes** | `standard` (default), `deep` (exhaustive), `fast` (low latency), `zeroRanking` (max raw volume) — and which are REST-only |
| **Result shape** | `{ link, title, description, relevance_score, content? }`; relevance-ranked |
| **Verification** | poll-before-read, block-page filtering, relevance sanity, error codes (401/403/404/429) |

### Reference files

- [skills/discover-api/SKILL.md](skills/discover-api/SKILL.md) — surfaces, modes, params, trigger/poll, verification
- [skills/discover-api/references/api-reference.md](skills/discover-api/references/api-reference.md) — full REST spec, per-surface param matrix, errors, limits

---

## Live Research Skill

The `live-research` skill turns one question into a **cited, synthesized brief** by fanning out intent-ranked Discover queries, reading the best sources, and writing findings with inline citations.

### What it covers

| Topic | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Decomposition** | Break a topic into 4–8 angles, each its own Discover call with a tailored `intent` (coverage via breadth, since `num_results` caps at 20) |
| **Retrieval** | Parallel `discover --include-content`; `deep` mode via REST for hard topics |
| **Merge & rank** | Dedup by normalized URL, sort by `relevance_score`, drop block-page content |
| **Synthesis** | Structured brief with inline `[n]` citations, contradictions surfaced, gaps named |
| **Quality bar** | Cite everything, prefer primary sources, never answer from training data |

### Reference files

- [skills/live-research/references/brief-template.md](skills/live-research/references/brief-template.md) — output structure and citation rules

---

## RAG Pipeline Skill

The `rag-pipeline` skill builds a retrieval-augmented-generation pipeline or a custom search engine using Discover as the retrieval layer for an LLM.

### What it covers

| Topic | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Two architectures** | Live retrieval (Discover at query time, always fresh) vs. ingestion (Discover → chunk → embed → vector store) |
| **Live retrieval** | Over-fetch by `relevance_score`, filter block pages, assemble a cited prompt |
| **Ingestion** | Dedup → chunk (overlap, paragraph-aware) → embed → upsert with source provenance |
| **Bulk corpus** | REST `zeroRanking` for max volume, then fetch content separately |
| **Design rules** | Store provenance, validate `content` before embedding, re-ingest for freshness, keep embedder/vector store pluggable |

### Reference files

- [skills/rag-pipeline/SKILL.md](skills/rag-pipeline/SKILL.md) — architecture choice, design rules, verification

## API Reference

### Search & Scrape (Web Unlocker API)

```
POST https://api.brightdata.com/request
Authorization: Bearer <BRIGHTDATA_API_KEY>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "url": "<target_url>",
  "zone": "<BRIGHTDATA_UNLOCKER_ZONE>",
  "format": "raw",
  "data_format": "markdown" | "parsed_light"
}
```

### Data Feeds (Web Data API)

```
POST https://api.brightdata.com/datasets/v3/trigger?dataset_id=<id>
Authorization: Bearer <BRIGHTDATA_API_KEY>
Content-Type: application/json

[{"url": "<target_url>"}]
```

Then poll for results:
```
GET https://api.brightdata.com/datasets/v3/snapshot/<snapshot_id>?format=json
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### "BRIGHTDATA_API_KEY is not set"
```bash
export BRIGHTDATA_API_KEY="your-api-key"
```

### "BRIGHTDATA_UNLOCKER_ZONE is not set"
Create a Web Unlocker zone in your [dashboard](https://brightdata.com/cp):
```bash
export BRIGHTDATA_UNLOCKER_ZONE="your-zone-name"
```

### Data feeds timing out
Increase the polling timeout:
```bash
export BRIGHTDATA_POLLING_TIMEOUT=900
```

### Empty or malformed results
- Verify your API key is valid
- Check that your zone is active
- Ensure `jq` is installed
