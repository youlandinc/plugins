# Scraper Studio — recipes

End-to-end shell recipes. All assume `bdata` is installed and authenticated (`bdata login`).

## Recipe 1 — create + run a single page

```bash
# 1. Build the scraper, save full AI output for inspection
bdata scraper create https://example.com/product/1 \
    "Extract title, price, currency, image URL, and availability \
     from this product page" \
    --name product-v1 \
    --pretty -o create.json

# 2. Pull the collector_id out of the response
COLLECTOR_ID=$(jq -r '.collector_id // .id' create.json)
test -n "$COLLECTOR_ID" || { echo "no collector_id"; exit 1; }
echo "Built scraper: $COLLECTOR_ID"

# 3. Run it
bdata scraper run "$COLLECTOR_ID" https://example.com/product/2 \
    --pretty -o product-2.json

# 4. Verify
jq 'keys' product-2.json
```

## Recipe 2 — run one collector over many URLs (single batch call)

Pass the URL list to `bdata scraper run` directly via `--input-file` or `--urls`. The CLI POSTs the entire array to `/dca/trigger` in one request — one snapshot, one poll loop, one merged result array. This is the canonical batch shape from the Scraper Studio reference SDKs (`triggerWithUrls` / `trigger_with_urls`).

```bash
COLLECTOR_ID="c_mp3tuab31lswoxvpws"

# One URL per line, # comments and blank lines ignored
cat > urls.txt <<'EOF'
https://example.com/p/1
https://example.com/p/2
# https://example.com/p/3   ← skipped
https://example.com/p/4
EOF

bdata scraper run "$COLLECTOR_ID" --input-file urls.txt \
    --pretty -o out/results.json

# Or inline, comma-separated
bdata scraper run "$COLLECTOR_ID" \
    --urls "https://example.com/p/1,https://example.com/p/2,https://example.com/p/3" \
    --pretty -o out/results.json

# Or a JSON array — strings, or objects with a "url" field
echo '["https://example.com/p/1","https://example.com/p/2"]' > urls.json
bdata scraper run "$COLLECTOR_ID" --input-file urls.json -o out/results.json
```

Notes:
- Output is a single JSON array of N records, one per input URL. Aggregate downstream with `jq` if you need per-URL files.
- The default batch timeout is **3600s** (1h). Raise `--timeout` for very large lists if a poll attempt runs over.
- `--sync` is **incompatible** with multi-URL input — `/dca/crawl` accepts only one URL. Drop `--sync` for batch.
- **Do not** wrap `scraper run` in a `for url in ...; do bdata scraper run ... done` shell loop — that's N API calls and N snapshots instead of one. Use the input flags.

## Recipe 3 — try sync, fall back to async on timeout

If you expect most pages to be fast but some to be slow, `--sync` gives you the speed for the common case and exits with a `response_id` you can pick up async-style for the slow ones.

```bash
COLLECTOR_ID="c_mp3tuab31lswoxvpws"
url="https://example.com/might-be-slow"

# Try sync first; capture exit code
if ! bdata scraper run "$COLLECTOR_ID" "$url" --sync \
        --pretty -o result.json 2> err.log; then
    # Pull the response_id from the error output
    response_id=$(grep -oE 'r_[a-zA-Z0-9]+' err.log | head -1)
    if [ -n "$response_id" ]; then
        echo "Sync timed out — polling async for $response_id"
        # Re-run without --sync; the CLI will poll get_result
        bdata scraper run "$COLLECTOR_ID" "$url" \
            --pretty -o result.json
    else
        echo "Sync failed for non-timeout reason:" >&2
        cat err.log >&2
        exit 1
    fi
fi

jq 'keys' result.json
```

## Recipe 4 — recover a half-built collector after a failed create

When `create` fails or times out, the `collector_id` is still printed. You have options:

```bash
# Option A: inspect / finish in the web UI
echo "Open: https://brightdata.com/cp/scrapers/$COLLECTOR_ID"

# Option B: just try running it as-is — sometimes partial generation
# is enough for the fields you need
bdata scraper run "$COLLECTOR_ID" https://example.com/page --pretty

# Option C: delete it (web UI) and rebuild with a sharper description
```

Do **not** re-run `bdata scraper create` against the same URL — that builds a *new* collector and leaves the half-built one orphaned in your dashboard.

## Recipe 5 — large paginated page (let the auto-fallback work)

```bash
# A search-results URL that may have thousands of items
bdata scraper run "$COLLECTOR_ID" \
    "https://example.com/search?q=widgets&page=1..N" \
    --pretty -o all-widgets.json
```

What to expect in the output:
- Default realtime trigger runs first.
- After ~one poll cycle, the CLI prints a one-line notice that it's falling back to the batch endpoint (because the URL expanded past the realtime page limit).
- Polling switches to a 10 s interval and a 1-hour default timeout.
- When the batch completes, the full dataset is printed / saved.

If you need a longer timeout: pass `--timeout 7200` (2 hours).

## Recipe 6 — pin a `dev` version while iterating in the web UI

```bash
# Edit the scraper in the dashboard, save as the dev version
# Then run the dev version from the CLI:
bdata scraper run "$COLLECTOR_ID" https://example.com/page \
    --version dev --name iteration-7 \
    --pretty
```

`--name` tags the run so you can find it later in the dashboard's run history.

## Recipe 7 — self-healing loop (run → inspect → heal → approve → re-run)

The agent is the detector AND the approver: run, inspect, heal, review the
preview, approve, re-run.

```bash
COLLECTOR_ID="c_mp3tuab31lswoxvpws"
URL="https://example.com/product/1"

# 1. Run and inspect
bdata scraper run "$COLLECTOR_ID" "$URL" --json -o out.json

# 2. If the data is wrong, heal (stops at the approval gate)
bdata scraper heal "$COLLECTOR_ID" \
    "Price returns null — the selector moved; capture price + currency." \
    --url "$URL" --pretty -o heal.json
# heal.json: status=awaiting_approval, preview_result shows the fix

# 3. Review preview_result, then approve (or --reject)
if [ "$(jq -r '.status' heal.json)" = "awaiting_approval" ]; then
    bdata scraper approve "$COLLECTOR_ID" --url "$URL" --pretty -o approve.json
fi

# 4. Verify the committed fix
eval "$(jq -r '.next_step' approve.json) --json -o out.json"
jq '{price, currency}' out.json
```

For a fully autonomous fix (no review), use `bdata scraper heal …
--auto-approve`.
