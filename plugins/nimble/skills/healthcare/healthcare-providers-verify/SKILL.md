# Healthcare Providers Verify

Validate practitioner credentials against the NPI registry and authoritative
sources, powered by Nimble's web data APIs.

User request: $ARGUMENTS

**Before running any commands**, read `references/nimble-playbook.md` for Claude Code
constraints (no shell state, no `&`/`wait`, sub-agent permissions, communication style).

---

## Instructions

### Step 0: Preflight + WSA Discovery

**Sibling handoff check:** Before running full preflight, check if
`healthcare-providers-extract` or `healthcare-providers-enrich` ran earlier in this
session by following the Sibling Handoff pattern from `references/nimble-playbook.md`.
If same-day output exists, skip CLI check and profile load, and reuse WSA Layer 1/3
inventory. Only re-run Layer 2 if the verification focus changed.

**Otherwise, run full preflight** from `references/nimble-playbook.md` (5 simultaneous
Bash calls: date calc, today, CLI check, profile load, index.md load).

**Also simultaneously** — run WSA discovery and setup:
- `mkdir -p ~/.nimble/memory/{reports,healthcare-providers-verify/checkpoints}`
- `ls ~/.nimble/memory/healthcare-providers-verify/checkpoints/ 2>/dev/null`
- Run Layer 1 (vertical) and Layer 3 (general tools) WSA discovery from
  `references/wsa-reference.md`. Layer 2 (session-specific) runs after Step 1 when
  you know the user's specialty and verification focus.

Classify discovered agents into verification categories and validate with
`nimble agent get` per `references/wsa-reference.md`.

From the preflight results:
- CLI missing or API key unset -> `references/profile-and-onboarding.md`, stop
- Tag all `nimble` CLI calls: `nimble --client-source skill-healthcare-providers-verify <subcommand>`. MCP path: not yet supported — see `references/nimble-playbook.md` for status.
- Profile exists -> note it for context. Determine mode using smart date windowing
  from `references/nimble-playbook.md`:
  - **Full mode:** first run OR last run > 14 days ago
  - **Quick refresh:** last run < 14 days ago (re-verify only previously
    Unverified/Flagged practitioners)
  - **Same-day repeat:** if `last_runs.healthcare-providers-verify` is today, check
    for existing report at `~/.nimble/memory/reports/healthcare-providers-verify-*[today].md`.
    If found, ask: "Already ran today. Run again for fresh data?"
- No profile -> that's fine. This skill doesn't require onboarding. Proceed to Step 1.

### Step 1: Parse Input + Starting Questions

**Chained-from-sibling shortcut:** Check for same-day extract or enrich output:
```bash
ls ~/.nimble/memory/reports/healthcare-providers-extract-*$(date +%Y-%m-%d).md 2>/dev/null
ls ~/.nimble/memory/reports/healthcare-providers-enrich-*$(date +%Y-%m-%d).md 2>/dev/null
```
If a same-day report exists, parse the `{slug}` and load the provider data
(`providers.json` or `enriched.json`). This gives you names, credentials, specialties,
and locations — skip parsing and go directly to Step 2.

Parse `$ARGUMENTS` for input type using the Input Parsing Pattern from
`references/nimble-playbook.md`. Key routing:
- **Sibling output detected** (providers.json/enriched.json) -> proceed to Step 2
- **CSV/Sheet/pasted data detected** -> proceed to Step 2
- **Unclear** -> ask (counts as 1 of max 2 prompts)

**If input is clear**, confirm and ask one shaping question (plain text, not
AskUserQuestion):

> "Found **N practitioners** to verify. Quick questions:
> 1. What should I verify? (credentials, specialty, active status, practice address — or all)
> 2. Healthcare vertical? (ophthalmology, dental, dermatology, general, or other)"

**If input is ambiguous**, use AskUserQuestion (counts as 1 of max 2 prompts):

> **What practitioner data should I verify?**
> - Paste provider data directly (name + credentials + location, one per line)
> - Provide a CSV file path or Google Sheet URL
> - Or describe what you have (e.g., "a list of 50 ophthalmologists I need to
>   verify against the NPI registry")

Skip questions the user already answered in their initial message.

### Step 2: Analyze Input Data

Parse the input into structured records. For each practitioner, identify:
- **Claimed fields** — name, credentials, specialty, state/city, practice name
- **Verification targets** — which claims to check based on user's focus

**Minimum required fields:** Name + at least one of (credentials, state, specialty).
If a practitioner has only a name with no other identifiers, flag it:
"Cannot verify [name] — need at least a state, credential, or specialty to search."

Build a verification plan summary:

> "Analyzing **N practitioners** for verification:
> - Names: N/N present
> - Credentials claimed: N/N
> - Specialty claimed: N/N
> - State/location: N/N
>
> Starting NPI verification..."

Run Layer 2 WSA discovery now that you know the specialty:
```bash
nimble agent list --limit 50 --search "[specialty]"
nimble agent list --limit 50 --search "[registry-user-mentioned]"
```

See `references/wsa-reference.md` for session-specific discovery.

### Step 3: NPI Registry Lookup

**Prefer the NPPES API** — it returns structured JSON in one call instead of
search + extract (two calls). Build the query URL from the practitioner's fields:

```bash
nimble extract --url "https://npiregistry.cms.hhs.gov/api/?version=2.1&first_name=[First]&last_name=[Last]&state=[ST]&limit=5" --format markdown
```

Add `&taxonomy_description=[Specialty]` if the specialty is known and specific
enough. The API returns NPI number, status, credentials, taxonomy codes, addresses,
and enumeration dates — everything needed for verification in a single call.

**Fallback to web search** if the NPPES API returns zero results or errors:

```bash
nimble search --query "[Name] [Credential] [State] NPI registry" --max-results 5 --search-depth lite
```

Then extract the top result from an NPI source (see source priority below).

**Source priority (enforce in sub-agent prompts):**
1. NPPES API (`npiregistry.cms.hhs.gov/api/`) — preferred, structured JSON
2. `npidb.org/doctors/` — clean structured data, good fallback
3. `nppes.cms.hhs.gov` (provider-view pages) — official CMS source
4. Skip all others (healthline, hmedata, vitals, etc.) — inconsistent formatting

Tell sub-agents: "Only extract from NPPES API, npidb.org, or nppes.cms.hhs.gov.
Ignore other NPI aggregator sites."

**Search budget per provider:** Max 3 search queries + 1 extraction per
practitioner. If no NPI match after 3 attempts, mark as Unverified and move on.
Tell sub-agents: "Do not run more than 4 nimble commands per provider. Mark as
Unverified if no match by then."

For 10+ practitioners, use sub-agents (see Sub-Agent Strategy below).

**Key fields from NPI records** — see `references/npi-verification-patterns.md`
for the full list: NPI number, status, credentials, taxonomy/specialty,
enumeration date, last updated, practice address.

**Checkpoint enforcement:** After each sub-agent returns its batch results, the
main context MUST write the checkpoint before spawning the next step or presenting
results:
1. Receive sub-agent results
2. Write checkpoint: `echo '[results]' > ~/.nimble/memory/healthcare-providers-verify/checkpoints/{slug}/batch-{n}.json`
3. Continue to next step

Do NOT skip this — if the run fails between steps, the user loses all progress.

### Step 4: Cross-Reference and Verify

For each practitioner, compare claimed data against extracted NPI data. Follow the
verification logic in `references/npi-verification-patterns.md`:

1. **Name matching** — normalize both names and determine match level (Strong,
   Likely, Weak, No Match) per the name matching rules in the reference
2. **Credential matching** — compare claimed credentials against NPI record
3. **Specialty matching** — compare claimed specialty against NPI taxonomy using
   the taxonomy matching strategy in the reference
4. **Address matching** — compare claimed state/city against NPI practice address
5. **Status check** — verify NPI status is Active

**Assign verification status** per practitioner based on the totality of evidence:
- **Verified** — all claims match NPI record
- **Partially Verified** — NPI found, minor discrepancies
- **Unverified** — no NPI match found or unable to disambiguate
- **Flagged** — active mismatches requiring human review

See `references/npi-verification-patterns.md` for the detailed criteria for each
status and the mismatch severity levels (Critical vs Warning).

### Step 5: WSA Supplementary Verification (Optional)

If the user requested regulatory verification beyond NPI lookup, or if Step 5
left practitioners as Unverified that might benefit from additional sources:

Run verification-phase WSAs discovered in Step 0. See `references/wsa-reference.md`
for the verification phase mapping, agent evaluation, and fallback chains.

**Practice confirmation:** For Unverified practitioners, try confirming their
practice exists via practice-level WSAs or web search:
```bash
nimble search --query "[practice-name] [city] [state]" --max-results 5 --search-depth lite
```

**Regulatory verification:** For practitioners the user wants regulatory checks on:
```bash
nimble search --query "[name] [credentials] clinical trials OR FDA OR board certification" --max-results 5 --search-depth lite
```

### Step 6: Deduplication & Confidence Scoring

Follow the Entity Deduplication pattern from `references/nimble-playbook.md`.
Skill-specific dedup rules are in `references/provider-extraction-patterns.md`.

**NPI dedup check:** After all sub-agents return, scan for duplicate NPI numbers
across batches. If two different providers mapped to the same NPI, flag both as
"Flagged — possible NPI collision, requires human review." This catches data entry
errors and name confusion in the source provider list.

**Verification-specific scoring:** The verification status (Verified / Partially
Verified / Unverified / Flagged) replaces confidence scoring for this skill.
Each status includes a confidence qualifier:
- **High confidence** — 2+ NPI sources corroborate, strong name match
- **Medium confidence** — single NPI source, likely name match
- **Low confidence** — weak name match, partial field matches

### Step 7: Output

Present results as a verification report — showing status per practitioner with
specific mismatch details. Group by verification status, include a "What This
Means" section at the end.

```markdown
# Provider Verification: [N] Practitioners Checked
*[Date] | [V] Verified, [PV] Partially Verified, [U] Unverified, [F] Flagged*

## TL;DR
Verified [V] of [T] practitioners against the NPI registry. [F] flagged for
review: [brief description of critical issues]. [U] could not be verified —
[common reason].

## Verification Results

| # | Name | Claimed | NPI Status | Verification | Issues | Source |
|---|------|---------|------------|-------------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Dr. Jane Smith | MD, Retinal Surgery, TX | Active (NPI 1234567890) | Verified | — | [NPI](url) |
| 2 | Dr. John Doe | OD, Ophthalmology, CA | Active (NPI 0987654321) | Partially Verified | Subspecialty differs | [NPI](url) |
| 3 | Dr. Alex Chen | MD, Dentistry, NY | Not Found | Unverified | No NPI match | [NPPES query](api-url) |
| 4 | Dr. Pat Lee | DO, Cardiology, FL | Deactivated | Flagged | NPI deactivated 2024-01 | [NPI](url) |

## Flagged Practitioners (Requires Human Review)

### Dr. Pat Lee
**Claimed:** DO, Cardiology, FL
**NPI Record:** NPI 1122334455 — **Deactivated** (01/15/2024)
**Issues:**
- CRITICAL: NPI status is Deactivated since January 2024
- Credential matches (DO confirmed)
- Specialty matches (Cardiovascular Disease taxonomy)
**Source:** [NPI Record](url)
**Action needed:** Confirm if provider has re-registered or if this is a
different individual.

[Repeat per flagged practitioner]

## Unverified Practitioners

[List practitioners where no NPI match was found, with search queries attempted]

## Verification Summary
- **Verified:** [V] practitioners — all claims confirmed
- **Partially Verified:** [PV] — minor discrepancies noted
- **Unverified:** [U] — no NPI match (common names, missing identifiers)
- **Flagged:** [F] — critical issues requiring review

## Sources
[Clickable URL for every NPI lookup page used, grouped by practitioner]

## What This Means
[Actionable interpretation: which practitioners are safe to include in your
directory, which need follow-up, what the verification rate tells you about
your data quality. Suggest next steps for unverified/flagged records.]
```

**Source links are mandatory.** Every verification finding must trace back to a
source URL.

### Step 8: Save to Memory

Make all Write calls simultaneously:

- Report -> `~/.nimble/memory/reports/healthcare-providers-verify-{slug}-{date}.md`
- Verification data -> `~/.nimble/memory/healthcare-providers-verify/{slug}/verified.json`
- Profile -> update `last_runs.healthcare-providers-verify` in
  `~/.nimble/business-profile.json` (only if profile exists)
- Follow the wiki update pattern from `references/memory-and-distribution.md`: update
  `index.md` rows for all affected entity files, append a `log.md` entry for this run.
- Clean up checkpoint (complete run) or keep (partial run)

**Update sibling artifacts:** If `providers.json` or `enriched.json` exists for this
slug under `~/.nimble/memory/`, merge NPI numbers and verification status into those
files. Generate a verified CSV export at
`~/.nimble/memory/healthcare-providers-verify/{slug}/verified-{date}.csv` with all
verification columns (NPI, NPI Status, NPI Taxonomy, Verification Status). Offer
this export path in Step 9 so the user can copy it where needed.

### Step 9: Share, Distribute & Follow-ups

**Always offer distribution — do not skip.** Follow
`references/memory-and-distribution.md` for connector detection and sharing flow.

Notion: full verification report as a dated subpage.
Slack: TL;DR with verification counts and flagged items only.

**Follow-ups:**

- **"Tell me more about Dr. X"** -> show full verification detail
- **"Export as CSV"** -> generate CSV with verification statuses
- **"Re-verify flagged only"** -> re-run NPI search for Flagged/Unverified only
- **"What should I do about the flagged ones?"** -> actionable next steps per issue

**Sibling skill suggestions:**

> **Next steps:**
> - Run `healthcare-providers-extract` on unverified providers' practice URLs
>   to get fresh data
> - Run `healthcare-providers-enrich` to fill gaps in verified providers' records
> - Run `market-finder` to find additional practices in this area

---

## Sub-Agent Strategy

For batch verification (10+ practitioners), use `nimble-researcher` agents
(`agents/nimble-researcher.md`) to parallelize NPI lookups and extraction.

Follow the sub-agent spawning rules from `references/nimble-playbook.md`
(bypassPermissions, batch max 4, explicit Bash instruction, fallback on failure).

**Spawn pattern:** One agent per batch of 5 practitioners. Each agent runs Steps 3-4
for its assigned practitioners and returns verification records. Tell each agent to
use `nimble extract-batch` for its NPI result URLs where possible — one batch call
per agent is faster than sequential calls.

**Small batch optimization:** If fewer than 10 practitioners, run directly from the
main context instead of spawning agents.

**Fallback:** If any agent fails, run those verifications directly from the main
context. Never leave gaps in the output.

---

## Error Handling

See `references/nimble-playbook.md` for the standard error table (missing API key,
429, 401, empty results, extraction garbage). Skill-specific errors:

- **No NPI results for practitioner:** "Couldn't find an NPI record for [name] in
  [state]. The name may be too common, or the provider may practice under a
  different name. Want me to try with additional context (practice name, NPI number)?"
- **Multiple NPI matches:** "Found multiple NPI records for [name] in [state].
  Can you confirm which one? [list top 3 with NPI numbers and specialties]"
- **NPI page extraction returned garbage:** "The NPI lookup page appears to be
  JavaScript-rendered. Retrying with browser rendering..." (auto-retry with
  `--render` per the shared pattern)
- **CSV/Sheet parse error:** "Couldn't parse the input file. Expected columns with
  practitioner names and at least one identifier (state, specialty, or credentials).
  Can you paste the data directly instead?"
- **Insufficient data for verification:** "Cannot verify [N] practitioners — they
  have only a name with no state, credential, or specialty. Add identifiers or
  remove them from the list."
