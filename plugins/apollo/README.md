## ✅ Powerful Skills

High-value skills that chain multiple Apollo APIs into complete workflows:

| Skill | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/apollo:enrich-lead` | Drop a name, LinkedIn URL, or email and get a full contact card with company context and next actions |
| `/apollo:prospect` | Describe your ICP in plain English and get a ranked table of enriched decision-makers |
| `/apollo:sequence-load` | Find leads, enrich them, dedupe, and bulk-add them to an Apollo sequence with a preview before enrollment |
| `/apollo:analytics` | Ask any sales performance question and get formatted tables from real Apollo analytics data |


### `/apollo:enrich-lead`

Best for: one-off enrichment and fast lead lookups. <br>
Input: name, company, LinkedIn URL, or email <br>
Output: enriched profile (role, location, company context) and suggested next steps

### `/apollo:prospect`
Best for: turning an ICP into a shortlist fast. <br>
Input: ICP description (industry, size, geography, titles) <br>
Output: ranked lead table with enriched decision-makers

### `/apollo:sequence-load`
Best for: taking action on a list. <br>
Input: targeting criteria + target sequence <br>
Output: preview of candidates, enrichment + dedupe, then bulk enrollment into the sequence

### `/apollo:analytics`
Best for: answering performance questions without opening a dashboard. <br>
Input: any question about emails, calls, meetings, tasks, opportunities, sequences, or conversation intelligence <br>
Output: formatted tables with real Apollo data, broken down by rep, team, time, sequence, stage, or any other dimension


Important: sequence enrollment may trigger outbound depending on your sequence settings and sending configuration.

## 🧠 Model Recommendations (Quality-First)

Recommended: Opus (best quality)

Use Opus when you want the strongest reasoning and the most reliable multi-step tool orchestration.

- Best for: prospecting workflows, ambiguous matches, multi-step chaining, and anything high-stakes
- Tradeoff: higher latency and higher model usage cost on the Anthropic side

### Strong fallback: Sonnet (faster)

Use Sonnet when you want speed for quick lookups, smaller jobs, or rapid iteration.

- Best for: quick searches, lightweight enrichment, and tight loops
- Tradeoff: may require more user guidance for complex multi-step workflows

In Claude Code, you can switch models via `/model`.

## **⚠️** Apollo Credits and Safety

Some operations consume Apollo credits:

- People enrichment typically costs 1 credit per person
- Bulk enrichment consumes credits based on how many people are enriched

This plugin is designed to warn and request confirmation before credit-consuming actions by default.

Sequence safety:

- Adding contacts to a sequence can enroll them into an active sequence
- Depending on your sequence settings, outbound may start automatically
- Always verify your sequence name, sending account, and enrollment volume before confirming
