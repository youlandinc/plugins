# Firestore Native Agent Skills

> [!NOTE]
> Currently in beta (pre-v1.0), and may see breaking changes until the first stable release (v1.0).

This repository provides a set of agent skills to interact with [Firestore](https://cloud.google.com/firestore/docs) databases. These skills can be used with various AI agents, including [Antigravity](https://antigravity.google/), [Claude Code](https://claude.com/product/claude-code) and [Codex](https://developers.openai.com/codex), to manage your databases, collections, and documents using natural language prompts.

## Why Use Firestore Native Agent Skills?

- **Seamless Workflow:** Integrates seamlessly into your AI agent's environment. No need to constantly switch contexts for common database tasks.
- **Natural Language Queries:** Stop wrestling with complex commands. Explore schemas and query data by describing what you want in plain English.
- **Data Management:** Manage your Firestore data directly from your agent.
- **Code Generation:** Accelerate development by asking your agent to generate data classes and other code snippets based on your document structures.

- IAM Permissions:
    * Cloud Datastore User (`roles/datastore.user`)
    * Firebase Rules Viewer (`roles/firebaserules.viewer`)

## Getting Started

### Configuration

Please keep these env vars handy during the installation process:

- `FIRESTORE_PROJECT`: The GCP project ID.
- `FIRESTORE_DATABASE`: (Optional) The Firestore database ID. Defaults to `(default)`.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - Ensure [Application Default Credentials](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/gcloud) are available in your environment.

### Installation & Usage

To start interacting with your database, install the skills for your preferred AI agent, then launch the agent and use natural language to ask questions or perform tasks.

For the latest version, check the [releases page][releases].

[releases]: https://github.com/gemini-cli-extensions/firestore-native/releases

<details open>
<summary id="antigravity">Antigravity</summary>

You can use either of these two agents for Antigravity:
- [Antigravity CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli) version **v0.3.3** or higher
- [Antigravity 2.0](https://antigravity.google/product/antigravity-2) version **v0.3.3** or higher.

<blockquote>
💡 <strong>Tip — Migrating from Gemini CLI?</strong><br>
If you previously installed this extension with <code>gemini extensions install</code>, you can convert it to an Antigravity plugin instead of reinstalling from scratch:
<ul>
  <li><strong>On first launch of Antigravity CLI</strong>, accept the Migration Options prompt to automatically convert your installed Gemini CLI extensions to Antigravity plugins.</li>
  <li><strong>Or, from your terminal</strong>, run:
    <pre><code class="language-bash">agy plugin import gemini</code></pre>
  </li>
</ul>
See <a href="https://antigravity.google/docs/gcli-migration">Migrating from Gemini CLI</a> for details on plugins, context files (<code>GEMINI.md</code> / <code>AGENTS.md</code>), and MCP server config differences.

## Usage Examples

Interact with Firestore using natural language:

- **Document and Data Retrieval**:
  - "Show me the Firestore data for the test users qa_user_123 and qa_user_456 from the users-staging collection."
  - "Find all users in the users-staging collection whose wishlist contains product-glasses."
- **Document Updates and Cleanup**:
  - "For all 20 test users you just found, please remove product-glasses(inactive) from their wishlist."
  - "Update the document with ID order-987 in the orders collection to set the status to 'Shipped'."

## Supported Skills

The following skills are available in this repository:

- [Firestore Data](./skills/firestore-data/SKILL.md) - Handles NoSQL document operations and collection hierarchy exploration. Use for CRUD tasks and data retrieval. Provides flexible document manipulation and structured querying.

## Additional Agent Skills

Find additional skills to support your entire software development lifecycle at [github.com/gemini-cli-extensions](https://github.com/gemini-cli-extensions).

## Troubleshooting

Use the debug mode of your agent (e.g., `gemini --debug`) to enable debugging.

Common issues:

- "failed to find default credentials: google: could not find default credentials.": Ensure [Application Default Credentials](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/gcloud) are available in your environment. See [Set up Application Default Credentials](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/external/set-up-adc) for more information.
- "✖ Error during discovery for server: MCP error -32000: Connection closed": The database connection has not been established. Ensure your configuration is set via environment variables.
- "✖ MCP ERROR: Error: spawn .../toolbox ENOENT": The Toolbox binary did not download correctly. Ensure you are using the latest version of your agent.
- "cannot execute binary file": The Toolbox binary did not download correctly. Ensure the correct binary for your OS/Architecture has been downloaded. See [Installing the server](https://mcp-toolbox.dev/documentation/introduction/#install-toolbox) for more information.
