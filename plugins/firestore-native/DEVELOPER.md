# DEVELOPER.md

This document provides instructions for setting up your development environment and contributing to the Firestore Native Gemini CLI Extension project.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

1.  **Gemini CLI:** Install the Gemini CLI version v0.6.0 or above. Installation instructions can be found on the [official Gemini CLI documentation](https://google-gemini.github.io/gemini-cli/). You can verify your version by running `gemini --version`.
2.  **Firestore database:** For testing skills, you will need access to an active Firestore database.

## Developing the Extension

### Running from Local Source

This extension uses **Agent Skills** to interact with Firestore. The development process involves generating these skills locally and linking the extension to the Gemini CLI.

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/gemini-cli-extensions/firestore-native.git
    cd firestore-native

2.  **Install the Extension Locally:** Use the Gemini CLI to install the
    extension from your local directory.

    ```bash
    gemini extensions install .
    ```
    The CLI will prompt you to confirm the installation. Accept it to proceed.

3.  **Testing Changes:** After installation, start the Gemini CLI (`gemini`).
    You can now interact with the `firestore-native` skills to manually test your changes
    against your connected database.

## Testing

### Automated Skills Validation

A GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/presubmit-tests.yml`) is triggered
for every pull request. This workflow primarily verifies that the extension can
be successfully installed by the Gemini CLI.

All tools are currently tested in the [MCP Toolbox GitHub](https://github.com/googleapis/mcp-toolbox).

The skills themselves are validated using the `skills-validate.yml` workflow.

### Other GitHub Checks

*   **License Header Check:** A workflow ensures all necessary files contain the proper license header.
*   **Conventional Commits:** This repository uses [Release Please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please) to manage releases. Your commit messages must adhere to the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification.

## Maintainer Information

### Team

The primary maintainers for this repository are defined in the [`.github/CODEOWNERS`](.github/CODEOWNERS) file:

*   `@gemini-cli-extensions/senseai-eco`
*   `@gemini-cli-extensions/firestore-native-maintainers`

### Releasing

The release process is automated using `release-please`. It consists of an automated changelog preparation step followed by the manual merging of a Release PR. When the Release PR is merged, `release-please` creates a new GitHub tag and a corresponding GitHub Release.

#### Automated Changelog Enrichment

Before a Release PR is even created, a special workflow automatically mirrors
relevant changelogs from the core `googleapis/mcp-toolbox` dependency. This
ensures that the release notes for this extension accurately reflect important
upstream changes.

The process is handled by the [`mirror-changelog.yml`](.github/workflows/mirror-changelog.yml) workflow:

1. **Trigger:** The workflow runs automatically on pull requests created by
   Renovate for `toolbox` version updates.
2. **Parsing:** It reads the detailed release notes that Renovate includes in
   the PR body.
3. **Filtering:** These release notes are filtered to include only changes
   relevant to this extension. The relevance is determined by a keyword (e.g.,
   `firestore`), passed as an environment variable in the workflow file.
4. **Changelog Injection:** The script formats the filtered entries as
   conventional commits and injects them into the PR body within a
   `BEGIN_COMMIT_OVERRIDE` block.
5. **Release Please:** When the main Release PR is created, `release-please`
   reads this override block instead of the standard `chore(deps): ...` commit
   message, effectively mirroring the filtered upstream changelog into this
   project's release notes.

> **Note for Maintainers:** The filtering script is an automation aid, but it
> may occasionally produce "false positives" (e.g., an internal logging change
> that happens to contain the keyword). Before merging a `toolbox` dependency
> PR, maintainers must **review the generated `BEGIN_COMMIT_OVERRIDE` block**
> and manually delete any lines that are not relevant to the end-users of this
> extension. The curated override block is the final source of truth for the
> release changelog.

#### Release Process

1.  **Release PR:** When commits with conventional commit headers (e.g., `feat:`,
    `fix:`) are merged into the `main` branch, `release-please` will
    automatically create or update a "Release PR".
2.  **Merge Release PR:** A maintainer approves and merges the Release PR. This
    action triggers `release-please` to create a new GitHub tag and a
    corresponding GitHub Release.
