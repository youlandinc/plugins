# Instructions for developing `rill.yaml`

## Introduction

`rill.yaml` is a required configuration file located at the root of every Rill project. It defines project-wide settings, similar to `package.json` in Node.js or `dbt_project.yml` in dbt.

## Core Concepts

### Project metadata

There are no required properties in `rill.yaml`, but it is common to configure:

- `display_name`: Human-readable name shown in the UI
- `description`: Brief description of the project's purpose
- `compiler`: Deprecated property that is commonly found in old projects

### Default OLAP connector

The `olap_connector` property sets the default OLAP database for the project. Models output to this connector by default, and metrics views query from it unless explicitly overridden.

Common values are `duckdb` or `clickhouse`. If not specified, Rill initializes a managed DuckDB database and uses it as the default OLAP connector. 

### Mock users for security testing

The `mock_users` property defines test users for validating security policies during local development. Each mock user can have:

- `email` (required): The user's email address
- `name`: Display name
- `admin`: Boolean indicating admin privileges
- `groups`: List of group memberships
- Custom attributes for use in security policy expressions

When mock users are defined and security policies exist, a "View as" dropdown appears in the dashboard preview.

### Environment variables

The `env` property sets default values for non-sensitive variables. These can be referenced in resource files using templating syntax (`{{ .env.<variable> }}`). Sensitive secrets should go in `.env` instead.

### Resource type defaults

Project-wide defaults can be set for resource types using plural keys:

- `models`: Default settings for all models (e.g., refresh schedules)
- `metrics_views`: Default settings for all metrics views (e.g., `first_day_of_week`)
- `explores`: Default settings for explore dashboards (e.g., `time_ranges`, `time_zones`)
- `canvases`: Default settings for canvas dashboards

Individual resources can override these defaults.

### Path management

- `ignore_paths`: List of paths to exclude from parsing (use leading `/`)
- `public_paths`: List of paths to expose over HTTP (defaults to `['./public']`)

### Environment overrides

The `dev` and `prod` properties allow environment-specific configuration overrides.

## Minimal Example

A minimal `rill.yaml` for a new project:

```yaml
display_name: My Analytics Project
```

## Complete Example

A comprehensive `rill.yaml` demonstrating common configurations:

```yaml
display_name: Sales Analytics

        In `rill.yaml`, project-wide defaults can be specified for a resource type within a project. Unless otherwise specified, _individual resources will inherit any defaults_ that have been specified in `rill.yaml`. For available properties that can be configured, please refer to the YAML specification for each individual resource type - [model](models.md), [metrics_view](metrics-views.md), and [explore](explore-dashboards.md)

        :::note Use plurals when specifying project-wide defaults
        In your `rill.yaml`, the top-level property for the resource type needs to be **plural**, such as `models`, `metrics_views`, and `explores`.
        :::

        :::info Hierarchy of inheritance and property overrides
        As a general rule of thumb, properties that have been specified at a more _granular_ level will supersede or override higher-level properties that have been inherited. Therefore, in order of inheritance, Rill will prioritize properties in the following order:
        1. Individual [models](models.md)/[metrics_views](metrics-views.md)/[explore](explore-dashboards.md) object-level properties (e.g. `models.yaml` or `explore-dashboards.yaml`)
        2. [Environment](/developers/build/models/templating) level properties (e.g. a specific property that has been set for `dev`)
        3. [Project-wide defaults](#project-wide-defaults) for a specific property and resource type

        Primarily useful for [templating](/developers/build/connectors/templating), variables can be set in the `rill.yaml` file directly. This allows variables to be set for your projects deployed to Rill Cloud while still being able to use different variable values locally if you prefer.
        :::info Overriding variables locally
        Variables also follow an order of precedence and can be overridden locally. By default, any variables defined will be inherited from `rill.yaml`. However, if you manually pass in a variable when starting Rill Developer locally via the CLI, this value will be used instead for the current instance of your running project:
        ```bash
        rill start --env numeric_var=100 --env string_var="different_value"
        ```
        :::
        :::tip Setting variables through `.env`
        Variables can also be set through your project's `<RILL_PROJECT_HOME>/.env` file (or using the `rill env set` CLI command), such as:
        ```bash
        variable=xyz
        ```
        Similar to how [connector credentials can be pushed / pulled](/developers/build/connectors/credentials#pulling-credentials-and-variables-from-a-deployed-project-on-rill-cloud) from local to cloud or vice versa, project variables set locally in Rill Developer can be pushed to Rill Cloud and/or pulled back to your local instance from your deployed project by using the `rill env push` and `rill env pull` commands respectively.

The public_paths property defines a list of file or directory paths to expose over HTTP. By default, it includes ['./public']. The ignore_paths property specifies a list of files or directories that Rill excludes during ingestion and parsing. This prevents unnecessary or incompatible content from affecting the project.
