# Qt AI Skills

Official agentic skills for Qt software development
and quality assurance, designed for use with AI coding tools
such as Claude Code, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, and
GitHub Copilot.

Skills have been tested with frontier LLMs from the Claude,
Gemini, and GPT model families.

There is no settled industry standard for AI skill packaging.
Each platform has its own conventions. Our canonical format
uses `SKILL.md` with YAML frontmatter in a directory-based
structure — this works natively on Claude Code, Codex CLI,
and GitHub Copilot, and can be adapted to other platforms
through condensed variants. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)
for the full cross-platform story.

> These agentic development skills use AI and can make mistakes.
> Always double-check the output carefully.
>
> Before using the skills under Qt commercial licensing, make
> sure you have understood and agree to the
> [Qt AI Services Terms & Conditions](https://www.qt.io/terms-conditions/ai-services-2025-06).

## Skills

| Skill | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `qt-cpp-review` | Review | Deterministic linting + 6 parallel deep-analysis agents for Qt C++ code. Covers model rule compliance, memory ownership, thread safety, correctness, error handling, and performance. |
| `qt-qml-review` | Review | Deterministic QML linting (47+ rules) + parallel deep-analysis agents for bindings, layout, loaders, delegates, states, and performance. |
| `qt-qml` | Conceptual | QML best practices for writing, reviewing, fixing, and refactoring. Corrects systematic LLM pre-training biases around bindings, scoping, modules, JS interop, and types. |
| `qt-ui-design` | Conceptual | UI design and audit for Qt/QML, web, and embedded (MPU/MCU) targets. Covers screen layout, navigation, and UX review with platform-aware defaults for geometry, viewing distance, input, and locale. |
| `qt-qml-docs` | Process | Generates Markdown reference documentation for QML components and applications from .qml source files. |
| `qt-cpp-docs` | Process | Generates Markdown reference documentation for Qt/C++ source files — classes, modules, utilities, headers, and entry points. |
| `qt-qml-profiler` | Tool | Runs `qmlprofiler` on a 2D QML / Qt Quick application, parses the `.qtd` trace, and analyzes hotspots against the source code with frame-time, memory, and pixmap-cache summaries. Does not cover Qt Quick 3D. |
| `qt-qml-test` | Process | Generates Qt Quick Test cases (`tst_*.qml`) for QML components using `TestCase`, `SignalSpy`, and `tryCompare`. Handles single files and batches. Does not cover CMake or runner setup. |
| `qt-qml-test-run` | Tool | Builds and runs Qt Quick Test (`qmltestrunner`) tests for a CMake project, parses the JUnit XML, and writes a Markdown report. Opt-in CMake test-infrastructure wiring with `--wire-up`. Companion to `qt-qml-test`. |
| `qt-figma-token-extraction` | Process | Extracts design tokens, text styles, and variables from a Figma design system and produces a design-tokens.json plus ready-to-use QML singletons. |
| `qt-figma-component-generation` | Process | Extracts component metadata from a Figma design system and generates production-ready QML controls mapped to Qt Quick Controls 2 patterns. Requires tokens from `qt-figma-token-extraction`. |
| `qt-cmake-project` | Conceptual | Sets up and manages Qt 6 projects built with CMake — fresh projects, executables, libraries, QML modules, plugins, folder layout, and static resources. Corrects systematic LLM biases around qmake-isms and the legacy `qt5_*` macros. |

### Skill types

- **Review** — structured code review workflows combining
  deterministic linters with deep AI analysis
- **Process** — workflows and decision frameworks
  (architecture, build, test, documentation)
- **Conceptual** — mental model corrections for areas where
  LLMs consistently fail (declarative QML, C++/QML boundary,
  Widgets patterns, UI design)
- **Tool** — guidance on Qt CLI tools and testing solutions

## MCP Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `qt-documentation-mcp` | Hosted MCP server for Qt API documentation lookup across the latest release and active LTS branches. Bundled with the `qt-development-skills` plugin; also available standalone via the official MCP registry as `io.qt/qt-documentation-mcp`. |

### Qt Documentation MCP Tool

See [`mcp/qt-documentation-mcp/README.md`](mcp/qt-documentation-mcp/README.md)
for endpoint and manual setup instructions for AI clients other than
Claude Code.

## Skill Format

Every skill is a directory containing a `SKILL.md` file with
YAML frontmatter. This format aligns with what Claude Code and
Codex CLI support natively:

```yaml
---
name: qt-qml-review
description: >-
  Reviews QML source files for correctness, performance, and
  maintainability. Deterministic linting (47+ rules) plus
  parallel deep-analysis agents for bindings, layout, loaders,
  delegates, states, and performance.
license: LicenseRef-Qt-Commercial OR BSD-3-Clause
compatibility: >-
  Designed for Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, and similar agents.
metadata:
  author: qt-ai-skills
  version: "1.0"
  qt-version: "6.x"
---
```

### Key conventions

- **`name`** must be lowercase alphanumeric + hyphens, max
  64 chars, and must match the directory name
- **`description`** must describe what the skill does AND when
  to use it — front-load the key information in the first 250
  characters, as some platforms truncate beyond that point
- **SKILL.md body** should stay under 500 lines — move detailed
  content to `references/` files
- **Progressive disclosure**: agents load only
  `name`/`description` at startup, read `SKILL.md` body on
  activation, and pull `references/` files only when needed

## Multi-Tool Support

Skills are authored to be tool-agnostic wherever possible.
However, different AI coding tools consume skills in different
ways:

| Tool | Skill Location | Format | Notes |
|------|---------------|--------|-------|
| **Claude Code CLI** | `~/.claude/skills/` | SKILL.md + references (native) | Full directory model with progressive loading |
| **Codex CLI** | `~/.codex/skills/` | SKILL.md + references (native) | Full directory model; registered in `~/.codex/config.toml` |
| **Gemini CLI** | Extension `skills/` | SKILL.md + references (native) | Installed via `gemini extensions install`; `@file.md` imports |
| **GitHub Copilot** | `.github/skills/` or `.claude/skills/` (project), `~/.copilot/skills/` (personal) | SKILL.md + references (native) | Auto-discovered across Copilot CLI, coding agent, and VS Code; existing `.claude/skills/` setups Just Work |

### When platform-specific variants are needed

Most skills work across tools without changes. When a skill
needs to reach platforms that cannot read multi-file directories
(e.g. Windsurf, Amazon Q), create variants in a `platforms/`
directory:

```
skills/qt-qml-review/
├── SKILL.md                       # Core skill (tool-agnostic)
├── references/
│   ├── qml-lint-rules.md
│   └── qml-review-checklist.md
└── platforms/                     # Platform-specific variants
    └── windsurf.md                #   Self-contained compact variant
```

The `platforms/` directory is a convention for this repository.
See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for full details on
creating platform variants.

## Installation

Most AI coding tools can install skills directly from this
GitHub repository. Choose the method for your platform below.

### Claude Code CLI

Install as a plugin using the Claude Code CLI plugin system:

```
/plugin marketplace add TheQtCompanyRnD/agent-skills
/plugin install qt-development-skills
```

Or install individual skills manually:

```bash
# Symlink a skill into your personal skills directory
ln -s "$(pwd)/skills/qt-qml-review" ~/.claude/skills/qt-qml-review

# Or copy into a project for team use
cp -r skills/qt-qml-review .claude/skills/qt-qml-review
```

Claude Code auto-discovers skills — no restart needed.

### Codex CLI

Use Vercel's cross-platform skill installer:

```bash
npx skills add TheQtCompanyRnD/agent-skills
```

Or copy skills manually:

```bash
cp -r skills/qt-qml-review ~/.codex/skills/qt-qml-review
```

Restart Codex after adding skills.

> **Note:** Codex is evolving rapidly. If `~/.codex/skills/`
> does not work, try `~/.agents/skills/` or `.agents/skills/`
> in your project root.

### GitHub Copilot CLI

Copilot natively reads the same `SKILL.md` directory format as
Claude Code. Install individual skills using GitHub CLI (preview):

```bash
gh skill install TheQtCompanyRnD/agent-skills qt-qml-review
```

Or copy/symlink the skill into one of Copilot's discovery paths:

```bash
# User-wide (available in any project)
cp -r skills/qt-qml-review ~/.copilot/skills/qt-qml-review

# Or scoped to a specific project
cp -r skills/qt-qml-review .github/skills/qt-qml-review
```

Copilot also auto-discovers skills installed for Claude Code
under `.claude/skills/`, so a single install can serve both
tools. Use `/skills list` inside Copilot CLI to confirm what
loaded.

### VSCode Agents (Copilot and others)

Run `Chat: Install Plugin From Source` from the Command Palette.
Enter `https://github.com/TheQtCompanyRnD/agent-skills` (this repo) to clone and install

### Gemini CLI

Install as an extension:

```bash
gemini extensions install https://github.com/TheQtCompanyRnD/agent-skills
```

Or import skills into your project's context file:

```bash
# Add to GEMINI.md (loaded automatically)
echo '@skills/qt-qml-review/SKILL.md' >> GEMINI.md
```

## Documentation site

A browsable documentation site is built from the `docs/` directory
using [MkDocs Material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/)
and published at:

> **<https://doc.qt.io/agentictools/>**

The canonical repo is on Gerrit
(`codereview.qt-project.org/qtai/qtaiskills`); doc.qt.io builds are
driven by the `qtaiskills` Rundeck job in `tqtc-doctools` on each
push to the publishing branch.

### Local preview

Requires Python 3.12+:

```bash
pip install -r requirements-docs.txt
mkdocs serve
```

Then open <http://127.0.0.1:8000/agent-skills/> — the dev server
live-reloads on every save.

### Production build

```bash
mkdocs build --strict
```

Output goes to `site/`. `--strict` fails on broken links and
malformed nav, matching the GitHub Actions check.

### Adding a new skill page

1. Create `docs/skills/<skill-name>.md` (use an existing skill page
   as a template).
2. Add it to `nav:` in `mkdocs.yml`.
3. Add a row to the table in `docs/skills/index.md`.
4. Run `mkdocs serve` to verify.
