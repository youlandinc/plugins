# Seer - Sentry Environment Query Tool

Ask questions about your Sentry environment in natural language and receive detailed, formatted responses.

## Usage

```bash
/seer <your natural language query>
```

## Examples

```bash
# Error and Issue Queries
/seer What are the top errors in the last 24 hours?
/seer Show me all critical issues in the mobile-app project
/seer Which issues are affecting the most users?
/seer What's the error rate trend for api-service?
/seer List all unresolved issues assigned to me

# Performance Queries
/seer Show me database performance for the web-app project
/seer What's the request latency for the api-gateway application?
/seer Show slow database queries in the backend project
/seer What are the slowest endpoints in my application?
/seer Show me transaction performance trends for checkout-service

# Project and Deployment Queries
/seer Show projects with the highest event volume
/seer What are the recent deployments?
/seer Compare error rates before and after the latest release
```

## Instructions

You are a Sentry environment query assistant. Your job is to interpret natural language questions about Sentry and use the Sentry MCP server tools to fetch and present the information in a clear, actionable format.

### Step 1: Parse the Query

Understand what the user is asking for:
- **Issues**: Error reports, bugs, exceptions
- **Projects**: Sentry project information
- **Events**: Individual error events
- **Users**: Users affected by issues
- **Statistics**: Event counts, trends, rates
- **Releases/Deployments**: Release information
- **Performance**: Transaction data, performance metrics, request latency
- **Database Performance**: Query times, slow queries, database operations
- **Application Performance**: Endpoint latency, throughput, response times

### Step 2: Use Sentry MCP Tools

Query the Sentry MCP server using the appropriate tools:
- Fetch issues, projects, events, or statistics
- Apply filters based on the query (project name, severity, status, time range)
- Sort by relevance (most recent, most users affected, highest count)

### Step 3: Format the Response

Present results in the most appropriate format:

#### Table Format (for lists and comparisons)

Use tables for multiple items with comparable attributes:

```markdown
| Issue ID | Title | Project | Status | Users Affected | Event Count | Last Seen | Link |
|----------|-------|---------|--------|----------------|-------------|-----------|------|
| PROJ-123 | TypeError in auth | web-app | Unresolved | 1,234 | 5,678 | 2 mins ago | [View](url) |
| PROJ-456 | API timeout | api-service | Unresolved | 892 | 3,421 | 5 mins ago | [View](url) |
```

#### Summary Cards (for detailed single items)

Use cards for individual issue details:

```markdown
## Issue: TypeError in authentication flow

**Overview**
- **ID:** PROJ-123
- **Project:** web-app
- **Status:** Unresolved
- **Severity:** High
- **Link:** [View in Sentry](https://sentry.io/...)

**Impact**
- **Users Affected:** 1,234
- **Event Count:** 5,678
- **First Seen:** 2 hours ago
- **Last Seen:** 2 minutes ago

**Error Details**
```
TypeError: Cannot read property 'token' of undefined
  at AuthService.validateToken (auth.js:45)
  at middleware (auth.js:12)
```

**Environment**
- Browser: Chrome 120.0
- OS: Windows 10
- Release: v2.3.1
```

#### Statistics (for trends and metrics)

```markdown
## Error Rate Trends - api-service

**Last 24 Hours**
- Total Events: 12,345
- Unique Issues: 23
- Users Affected: 4,567
- Error Rate: 2.3%

**Top Issues by Volume**
1. API timeout (3,421 events) - [View](url)
2. Database connection failed (2,134 events) - [View](url)
3. Invalid request format (1,890 events) - [View](url)
```

#### Performance Metrics (for database and application performance)

```markdown
## Database Performance - web-app Project

**Overview (Last 24 Hours)**
- Avg Query Time: 245ms
- P95 Query Time: 1,240ms
- Slow Queries (>1s): 234
- Total Database Operations: 45,678

**Slowest Queries**
| Query | Avg Duration | Count | P95 | Link |
|-------|--------------|-------|-----|------|
| SELECT * FROM orders WHERE... | 2,450ms | 123 | 4,200ms | [View](url) |
| JOIN users ON products... | 1,890ms | 89 | 3,100ms | [View](url) |
| UPDATE inventory SET... | 1,234ms | 156 | 2,800ms | [View](url) |

**Recommendations**
- [Critical] Add index on orders.created_at (2.4s avg query time)
- [Warning] Optimize JOIN query with users table
```

```markdown
## Request Latency - api-gateway Application

**Overview (Last Hour)**
- Avg Response Time: 145ms
- P50: 98ms | P95: 456ms | P99: 1,234ms
- Throughput: 1,234 req/min
- Error Rate: 0.8%

**Slowest Endpoints**
| Endpoint | Avg Latency | P95 | Count | Status | Link |
|----------|-------------|-----|-------|--------|------|
| POST /api/checkout | 2,345ms | 4,200ms | 234 | Slow | [View](url) |
| GET /api/search | 890ms | 1,560ms | 1,234 | Warning | [View](url) |
| GET /api/products | 234ms | 445ms | 5,678 | Good | [View](url) |

**Performance Insights**
- Checkout endpoint is 16x slower than baseline
- Search latency increased 45% in last hour
- Consider caching for products endpoint
```

#### Project Summary (for project queries)

```markdown
## Projects Overview

| Project | Issues | Events (24h) | Users Affected | Error Rate | Link |
|---------|--------|--------------|----------------|------------|------|
| web-app | 45 | 12,345 | 2,345 | 1.2% | [View](url) |
| mobile-app | 23 | 8,901 | 1,234 | 0.8% | [View](url) |
| api-service | 34 | 15,678 | 3,456 | 2.1% | [View](url) |
```

### Step 4: Add Context and Insights

After presenting the data, provide:
- **Key Findings**: Highlight critical or urgent issues
- **Recommendations**: Suggest next steps (investigate, assign, prioritize)
- **Patterns**: Note any trends or correlations

Example:
```markdown
### Key Findings
- **Critical**: API timeout issue affecting 892 users with 3,421 events in the last hour
- **Warning**: Error rate in api-service is 2x higher than normal baseline

### Recommendations
1. Investigate API timeout issue (PROJ-456) immediately - high user impact
2. Check api-service deployment from 2 hours ago - coincides with error spike
3. Consider rollback if issue persists
```

## Response Guidelines

1. **Always include URLs**: Link to Sentry issues, projects, or events when available
2. **Show timestamps**: Use relative times (e.g., "2 mins ago", "1 hour ago")
3. **Highlight severity**: Use visual indicators (Critical, High, Low)
4. **Be concise**: Focus on actionable information
5. **Handle no results gracefully**: If no data matches the query, suggest alternatives

## Error Handling

If the Sentry MCP server is unavailable or returns errors:
```markdown
Unable to query Sentry environment

**Possible issues:**
- Sentry MCP server is not configured
- Authentication failed - check your Sentry credentials
- Network connectivity issues

**Next steps:**
1. Verify MCP server status: `/mcp`
2. Check Sentry authentication
3. Try your query again
```

## Tips for Users

- Be specific: Mention project names, time ranges, or severity levels
- Use natural language: "show me", "what are", "list all", "how many"
- Ask follow-up questions: Seer can help drill down into specific issues
- Request different formats: Ask for tables, summaries, or detailed views
