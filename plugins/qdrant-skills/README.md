    <b>Agent skills for building with Qdrant vector search</b>
</p>

Skills encode deep Qdrant knowledge so coding agents can make the engineering decisions that determine whether vector search works well: quantization, sharding, tenant isolation, hybrid search, model migration, and more.

## Philosophy

Skills are not documentation. Qdrant already has docs in markdown. Skills
answer "when?" and "why?", not "how?"

They are structured as the handbook of a Solutions Architect working on Qdrant:
given a problem, navigate to the exact place in the documentation where the
answer lives. No tutorials, no concept explanations. Only references and
minimal snippets where absolutely necessary.

## Disclaimer

These skills are under active development. Skill content and structure may change between versions as Qdrant evolves.

## Usage

Skills are hosted at [skills.qdrant.tech](https://skills.qdrant.tech). Pass the URL of a skill directly to your agent — no installation required:

```
Use skills.qdrant.tech
```

This keeps your agent's context focused: it fetches only the skill relevant to your current problem rather than loading everything upfront.

If you prefer skills to be available offline or without passing URLs manually, you can install them locally. Refer to the [Installation](#installation) section.

## Quick Start

The recommended way is the URL method: ask your agent about Qdrant and pass [skills.qdrant.tech](https://skills.qdrant.tech) in your prompt.

```
"I have 50M vectors on a single node and search is slow, should I add more nodes? Use skills.qdrant.tech"

"My search results are returning irrelevant matches. Use skills.qdrant.tech"
```

If you use the installation method, just ask your agent about Qdrant. Skills are triggered automatically when your question matches their description.

```
"I have 50M vectors on a single node and search is slow, should I add more nodes?"
→ qdrant-scaling skill activates, recommends quantization and vertical scaling before adding nodes

"My search results are returning irrelevant matches"
→ qdrant-search-quality skill activates, walks through diagnosis and search strategy options

"How do I switch from OpenAI embeddings to Cohere without downtime?"
→ qdrant-model-migration skill activates, guides zero-downtime migration with dual vectors
```

## Skills

## Installation

### npx skills

Install using the [`npx skills`](https://skills.sh) CLI:

```bash
npx skills add qdrant/skills
```

### Claude Code

Add the marketplace, then install all Qdrant skills:

```
/plugin marketplace add qdrant/skills
/plugin install qdrant@qdrant
```

### Cursor

Install from the Cursor Marketplace or add manually via **Settings > Rules > Add Rule > Remote Rule (GitHub)** with `qdrant/skills`.

### Clone / Copy

Clone this repo and copy the skill folders into the appropriate directory for your agent:

| Agent | Skill Directory | Docs |

## MCP Servers

For additional Qdrant context, pair skills with these MCP servers:

| Server | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| [mcp-code-snippets](https://github.com/qdrant/mcp-code-snippets) | Search Qdrant docs and code examples across all SDKs |
| [mcp-server-qdrant](https://github.com/qdrant/mcp-server-qdrant) | Store and retrieve memories, manage collections directly |
