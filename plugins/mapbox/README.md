# Mapbox Agent Skills

**Comprehensive Agent Skills** that teach AI assistants how to build fast, beautiful, secure Mapbox applications across **Web, iOS, and Android** platforms. Covers performance optimization, cartographic design, framework integration, platform migration, search integration, geospatial operations, and security best practices.

## Quick Start

### Codex Plugin Local Testing

This repository includes a Codex plugin manifest at `plugins/mapbox/.codex-plugin/plugin.json` and a repo marketplace at `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`.

Codex marketplaces currently expect a plugin subdirectory such as `plugins/mapbox`. To avoid maintaining a second tracked copy of every skill, keep editing the root `skills/` directory and generate the local plugin package before testing:

```bash
npm run build:codex-plugin
codex plugin marketplace add .
codex plugin marketplace list
```

Then restart Codex and install the `mapbox` plugin from the `Mapbox Agent Skills` marketplace.

The generated `plugins/mapbox/skills/` and `plugins/mapbox/.mcp.json` files are ignored by git.

### Open Plugins (Cursor, Codex, GitHub Copilot, Claude Code)

This repository conforms to the [Open Plugins specification](https://open-plugins.com/), making it installable in any conformant tool - Cursor, Codex, GitHub Copilot, Claude Code, and more.

Add the marketplace source:

```
/plugin marketplace add mapbox/mapbox-agent-skills
```

Then install the plugin:

```
/plugin install mapbox
```

### Claude Plugin (Claude Code)

Install as a Claude Code plugin to get skills and MCP servers in one step:

```
/plugin marketplace add mapbox/mapbox-agent-skills
```

Then install the plugin:

```
/plugin install mapbox
```

This adds all Mapbox skills and connects the `mapbox`, `mapbox-devkit`, and `mapbox-docs` MCP servers automatically.

### Skills CLI

Install all Mapbox Agent Skills:

```bash
npx skills add mapbox/mapbox-agent-skills
```

Install specific skills:

```bash
npx skills add mapbox/mapbox-agent-skills --skill mapbox-web-performance-patterns
```

List available skills:

```bash
npx skills add mapbox/mapbox-agent-skills --list
```

> **💡 Pro tip:** These skills work great on their own, but they're even more powerful when combined with the [Mapbox MCP DevKit Server](https://github.com/mapbox/mcp-devkit-server). Skills provide the expertise (performance patterns, design principles), while MCP tools provide the actions (create styles, generate previews). Together, they enable complete workflows from design to deployment.

## What are Agent Skills?

Agent Skills are folders containing instructions and resources that AI assistants (like Claude Code, Cursor, GitHub Copilot) can discover and use to perform tasks more effectively. Unlike tools (which provide actions) or prompts (which provide workflows), skills provide **domain expertise** - the "know-how" that helps AI make informed decisions.

Think of skills as giving your AI assistant a specialized education in Mapbox development best practices.

## Available Skills

## How Skills Work

### With Claude Code

Skills in this repository are automatically discovered by Claude Code when placed in:

```bash
# Install all skills
npx skills add mapbox/mapbox-agent-skills

# Or manually symlink (for development)
mkdir -p .claude
ln -s ~/git/mapbox-agent-skills/skills .claude/skills
```

Skills are automatically activated when relevant to your task.

### With Cursor

```bash
npx skills add mapbox/mapbox-agent-skills -a cursor
```

### With VS Code (GitHub Copilot)

```bash
npx skills add mapbox/mapbox-agent-skills -a vscode
```

### With Other AI Assistants

The `skills` CLI supports: OpenCode, Codex, Antigravity, and more. Run `npx skills add --help` for full list.

### Manual Installation

If your AI assistant doesn't support the `skills` CLI, you can copy skill files directly:

```bash
# For Claude Code — copy SKILL.md into .claude/skills/
mkdir -p .claude/skills/mapbox-web-performance-patterns
curl -o .claude/skills/mapbox-web-performance-patterns/SKILL.md \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mapbox/mapbox-agent-skills/main/skills/mapbox-web-performance-patterns/SKILL.md

# For Codex, Copilot, and other AGENTS.md-based tools — copy to project root
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mapbox/mapbox-agent-skills/main/skills/mapbox-web-performance-patterns/AGENTS.md
```

## Example Usage

Once installed, skills activate automatically when relevant:

### Performance Optimization

👤 User: "My Mapbox map with 5,000 restaurant markers is slow. How do I optimize it?"

🤖 Claude: [Uses mapbox-web-performance-patterns skill]

"Based on the marker performance thresholds:

- < 100 markers: HTML markers OK
- 100-1,000: Use Symbol layers (GeoJSON)
- 1,000-10,000: Clustering required
- > 10,000: Server-side clustering

For 5,000 markers, you need clustering. Here's the pattern..."

### Framework Integration

👤 User: "Set up Mapbox in my React app"

🤖 Claude: [Uses mapbox-web-integration-patterns skill]

"I'll use the React pattern with useRef + useEffect:

```jsx
import { useRef, useEffect } from 'react';
import mapboxgl from 'mapbox-gl';
import 'mapbox-gl/dist/mapbox-gl.css';

function MapComponent() {
  const mapRef = useRef(null);
  const mapContainerRef = useRef(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    mapboxgl.accessToken = import.meta.env.VITE_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN;

    mapRef.current = new mapboxgl.Map({
      container: mapContainerRef.current,
      center: [-71.05953, 42.3629],
      zoom: 13
    });

    // CRITICAL: Cleanup to prevent memory leaks
    return () => {
      mapRef.current.remove();
    };
  }, []);

  return <div ref={mapContainerRef} style={{ height: '100vh' }} />;
}
```

Key points:

- Use useRef for both map instance and container
- Initialize in useEffect with empty deps []
- Always return cleanup function that calls map.remove()
- Never initialize map in render (causes infinite loops)"

### Map Design

👤 User: "Create a map style for a restaurant finder app"

🤖 Claude: [Uses mapbox-cartography + mapbox-style-patterns skills]

"For a restaurant finder, you need:

Design (from cartography skill):

- High contrast for restaurant markers
- Muted background (food photos will overlay)
- Clear street labels for navigation
- Mobile-optimized design

Style pattern (from style-patterns skill):
I'll apply the POI Finder pattern:

- Desaturated base map (#f5f5f5 background)
- Orange markers (#FF6B35) for visibility
- White roads on light gray background
- Simplified labels (only major streets)
  ..."

## How Skills Complement Mapbox MCP Server
