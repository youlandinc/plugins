# Setup

## Required Gemini CLI Version

To install this extension, the Gemini CLI version must be v0.6.0 or above. The version can be found by running: `gemini --version`.

## AlloyDB Omni Skills (Data Plane: Connecting and Querying)

This section covers connecting to an AlloyDB database instance.

1.  **Verify Environment Variables**: The extension requires the following environment variables to be set before the Gemini CLI is started:

    *   `ALLOYDB_OMNI_HOST`: The host of the AlloyDB instance, default is `localhost`.
    *   `ALLOYDB_OMNI_PORT`: The port of the AlloyDB instance, default is `5432`.
    *   `ALLOYDB_OMNI_DATABASE`: The name of the database.
    *   `ALLOYDB_OMNI_USER`: The username for the database.
    *   `ALLOYDB_OMNI_PASSWORD`: The password for the database user.
    *   `ALLOYDB_OMNI_QUERY_PARAMS`: (Optional) Additional query parameters.

    If you need to update any of these values later, use the `gemini extensions config alloydb-omni` command.

2.  **Handle Missing Variables**: If a command fails with an error message containing a placeholder like `${ALLOYDB_OMNI_HOST}`, it signifies a missing environment variable. Inform the user which variable is missing and instruct them to set it.
