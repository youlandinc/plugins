# Run Collection Tests

Execute Postman collection tests directly from Claude Code. Analyze results, diagnose failures, and suggest code fixes.

## Prerequisites

The Postman MCP Server must be connected. If MCP tools aren't available, tell the user: "Run `/postman:setup` to configure the Postman MCP Server."

## Workflow

### Step 1: Find the Collection

1. Call `getWorkspaces` to find the target workspace
2. Call `getCollections` with the `workspace` parameter. Use the `name` filter if the user specified a collection.
3. If the user provides a collection ID directly, skip to Step 2.

### Step 2: Run Tests

Call `runCollection` with the collection UID in `OWNER_ID-UUID` format. Get the UID from the `getCollection` response's `uid` field.

If the collection uses environment variables:
1. Call `getEnvironments` to list available environments
2. Ask which environment to use (or detect from naming convention)
3. Pass the environment ID to `runCollection`

### Step 3: Parse Results

Present results clearly:

```
Test Results: Pet Store API
  Requests:  15 executed
  Passed:    12 (80%)
  Failed:    3
  Avg time:  245ms

  Failures:
  1. POST /users → "Status code is 201" → Got 400
     Request: createUser
     Folder: User Management

  2. GET /users/{id} → "Response has email field" → Missing
     Request: getUser
     Folder: User Management

  3. DELETE /users/{id} → "Status code is 204" → Got 403
     Request: deleteUser
     Folder: User Management
```

### Step 4: Diagnose Failures

For each failure:
1. Call `getCollectionRequest` to see the full request definition
2. Call `getCollectionResponse` to see expected responses
3. Check if the API source code is in the current project
4. Explain what the test expected vs what happened
5. If code is local, find the handler and suggest the fix

### Step 5: Fix and Re-run

After fixing code:
1. Offer to re-run: "Tests fixed. Want me to run the collection again?"
2. Call `runCollection` again
3. Show before/after comparison

### Step 6: Update Collection (if needed)

If the tests themselves need updating (not the API):
- Call `updateCollectionRequest` to fix request bodies, headers, or test scripts
- Call `updateCollectionResponse` to update expected responses

## Error Handling

- **MCP not configured:** "Run `/postman:setup` to configure the Postman MCP Server."
- **Collection not found:** "No collection matching that name. Run `/postman:search` to find available collections, or `/postman:sync` to create one."
- **401 Unauthorized:** "Your Postman API key was rejected. Generate a new one at https://go.postman.co/settings/me/api-keys and run `/postman:setup`."
- **MCP timeout:** Retry once. For large collections, suggest running a single folder to narrow the test run.
- **Plan limitations:** "Collection runs may require a Postman Basic plan or higher for increased limits."
