Together AI RAG Pipeline -- Embed, Retrieve, Generate (v2 SDK)

Demonstrates a complete Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipeline using
Together AI embeddings and chat completions.

Uses an in-memory vector store for simplicity. Replace with your preferred
vector database (Pinecone, Weaviate, Chroma, etc.) for production use.

Note: Reranking requires a dedicated endpoint and is not included in this
pipeline. See https://docs.together.ai/docs/rerank-overview for details.

Usage:
    python rag_pipeline.py

Requires:
    uv pip install "together>=2.0.0"
    export TOGETHER_API_KEY=your_key
