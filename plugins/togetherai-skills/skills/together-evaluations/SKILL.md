description: "LLM-as-a-judge evaluation framework on Together AI. Classify, score, and compare model outputs, select judge models, use external-provider judges or targets, poll results and download reports. Reach for it whenever the user wants to benchmark outputs, grade responses, compare A/B variants, or operationalize automated evaluations."

# Together AI Evaluations

## Overview

Use Together AI evaluations when the user wants a managed LLM-as-a-judge workflow rather than an
ad hoc prompt loop.

Core evaluation types:

- **Classify**: assign outputs to labels
- **Score**: grade outputs on a numeric scale
- **Compare**: compare two candidate outputs with bias controls

This skill also covers external providers used as judges or targets when the workflow still runs
through Together AI's evaluation system.

## When This Skill Wins

- Benchmark prompt variants, models, or product responses
- Grade quality, safety, policy compliance, or task success
- Run A/B comparisons between model outputs
- Build repeatable evaluation jobs with uploaded datasets
- Pull results programmatically after asynchronous execution

## Hand Off To Another Skill

- Use `together-chat-completions` for one-off inference or manual judge prompts
- Use `together-batch-inference` for bulk offline generation rather than evaluation
- Use `together-fine-tuning` when the user wants to improve the model instead of just measure it
- Use `together-dedicated-endpoints` only if the evaluation target itself is a dedicated endpoint

## Quick Routing

- **Classify / Score / Compare job setup**
  - Start with [scripts/run_evaluation.py](scripts/run_evaluation.py) or [scripts/run_evaluation.ts](scripts/run_evaluation.ts)
  - Read [references/api-reference.md](references/api-reference.md) for exact request shapes
- **Dataset formatting**
  - Read the dataset sections in [references/api-reference.md](references/api-reference.md)
- **Dataset columns, Jinja2 templates, or pre-generated responses**
  - Read the dataset and template sections in [references/api-reference.md](references/api-reference.md)
  - Use `--eval-column`, `--model-a-column`, or `--model-b-column` in the scripts
- **External providers as judge or target**
  - Read the model-source and provider sections in [references/api-reference.md](references/api-reference.md)
  - Use the scripts with `--judge-model-source external`, `--eval-model-source external`, or compare-side source flags
- **Polling, listing, or downloading results**
  - Use the retrieval endpoints documented in [references/api-reference.md](references/api-reference.md)
  - Use `--download-results` in the scripts when you want the per-row JSONL locally

## Workflow

1. Identify whether the user needs classify, score, or compare.
2. Define the dataset schema before writing code.
3. Upload the dataset as an eval file and keep the returned file ID.
4. Configure judge and target models explicitly, especially when mixing providers.
5. Poll status until completion, then download the result file for analysis.

## High-Signal Rules

- Python scripts require the Together v2 SDK (`together>=2.0.0`). If the user is on an older version, they must upgrade first: `uv pip install --upgrade "together>=2.0.0"`.
- The current SDK examples in this repo use `check=False` for eval uploads because local file validation can misclassify eval datasets.
- Treat dataset schema as part of the product contract; inconsistent fields cause downstream confusion.
- Compare evaluations are best when both candidate responses are already present in the dataset.
- Keep judge configuration explicit. Hidden defaults make benchmark interpretation harder.
- Use Together AI's managed evaluation job instead of rebuilding a manual judge loop when repeatability matters.
