description: Show failing Vanta compliance tests, prioritized by what can be fixed from this repository
---

Show the user their failing Vanta tests, ranked by what the plugin can help with.

## Steps

1. **Fetch failing tests.** Call `tests` to get all tests with status `NEEDS_ATTENTION`.
2. **Categorize and rank tests.** Group the failing tests into tiers:
   **Ready to fix** — Tests where:
    - The test's integration matches resources likely managed in this repo. Detect this by checking for deployment code: look for provider declarations (`provider "aws"` in `.tf` files for AWS, `provider "google"` for GCP, `provider "azurerm"` for Azure) **and** resource type prefixes (`aws_`, `google_`, `azurerm_`) in `.tf` files; or `AWSTemplateFormatVersion` in CloudFormation templates; or `cdk.json` for CDK projects. Use both signals — provider blocks are often absent in child modules or Terragrunt configs.
    - Present these first. These are one-command fixes with `/vanta:fix-test <testId>`.
   **Fixable with guidance** — Tests that are code-remediable but may not match this repo (different cloud provider, different integration). The user can still get remediation code, but may need to apply it elsewhere.
   **Manual steps needed** — Tests that require configuration changes in external tools, Vanta settings, or manual processes. The plugin can provide guidance but not generate code.
3. **Present the results.** For each tier, show a table with columns:
    - Test name
    - Test ID
    - Number of failing entities
    - Integration (e.g., AWS, GitHub, Azure)
    - How long the test has been failing (from `latestFlipDate`)
    - For "Ready to fix" tests, show: `Run /vanta:fix-test <testId> to generate a PR`
4. **Highlight co-failure clusters.** If multiple failing tests map to the same resource type or integration, note this. For example: "5 IAM tests are failing — fixing the password policy may resolve all of them at once."
5. **Keep it scannable.** Use a table or bulleted list. Do not dump raw API responses. The user needs to quickly see what to fix first.

## Edge cases
- **No failing tests:** "All tests are passing. Nice work." Do not show an empty table.
- **User asks to filter (e.g., "show AWS tests"):** Filter by integration name. If no failures match the filter, say so and show the full list: "No failing AWS tests found. Here's what is failing across other integrations:"
- **User asks to filter by framework (e.g., "SOC 2 gaps"):** Filter by framework. "You have [N] failing tests mapped to SOC 2. Here are the ones I can help fix from this repo."
- **User asks "what should I fix first?":** Rank by impact: IaC-fixable in this repo first, then highest entity count, then longest time failing. Highlight co-failure clusters as "biggest bang for the buck."
- **Very large number of failing tests:** Group by integration and summarize counts rather than listing every test. Show the top 5-10 highest-impact items with a note: "[N] more tests failing. Want to see the full list or focus on [integration]?"
