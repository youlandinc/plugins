# Agent Skills: Knowledge Catalog (formerly known as Dataplex)

> [!NOTE]
> Currently in beta (pre-v1.0), and may see breaking changes until the first stable release (v1.0).

This repository provides a set of agent skills to interact with [Knowledge Catalog](https://cloud.google.com/dataplex/docs) (formerly known as Dataplex) instances. These skills can be used with various AI agents, including [Antigravity](https://antigravity.google/), [Claude Code](https://claude.com/product/claude-code) and [Codex](https://developers.openai.com/codex), to discover, manage, monitor, and govern data and AI artifacts across your data platform using natural language prompts.

## Why Use Knowledge Catalog Agent Skills?

* **Natural Language Management:** Stop wrestling with complex commands. Explore schemas and query data by describing what you want in plain English.
* **Seamless Workflow:** Integrates seamlessly into your AI agent's environment. No need to constantly switch contexts for common database tasks.
* **Code Generation:** Accelerate development by asking your agent to generate data classes and other code snippets based on your table schemas.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- One of these AI agents installed
  - Antigravity
     - [Antigravity CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli) version **v1.6.0** or higher
     - [Antigravity 2.0](https://antigravity.google/product/antigravity-2) version **v2.0.0** or higher.
  - [Claude Code](https://claude.com/product/claude-code) version **v2.1.94** or higher.
  - [Codex](https://developers.openai.com/codex) **v0.117.0** or higher.
- A Google Cloud project with the **Dataplex API** enabled.
- Ensure [Application Default Credentials](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/gcloud) are available in your environment.
- IAM Permissions:
  * Dataplex Data Reader (`roles/dataplex.dataReader`): For reading data from the underlying assets (e.g., to run analytics queries).
  * Service Usage Consumer (`roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageConsumer`)

## Getting Started

### Configuration

Please keep these env vars handy during the installation process:

*   `DATAPLEX_PROJECT`: The GCP project ID.

### Installation & Usage

To start interacting with your database, install the skills for your preferred AI agent, then launch the agent and use natural language to ask questions or perform tasks.

For the latest version, check the [releases page][releases].

<summary id="antigravity">Antigravity</summary>

You can use either of these two agents for Antigravity:
- [Antigravity CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli) version **v0.5.3** or higher
- [Antigravity 2.0](https://antigravity.google/product/antigravity-2) version **v0.5.3** or higher.

<blockquote>
💡 <strong>Tip — Migrating from Gemini CLI?</strong><br>
If you previously installed this extension with <code>gemini extensions install</code>, you can convert it to an Antigravity plugin instead of reinstalling from scratch:
<ul>
  <li><strong>On first launch of Antigravity CLI</strong>, accept the Migration Options prompt to automatically convert your installed Gemini CLI extensions to Antigravity plugins.</li>
  <li><strong>Or, from your terminal</strong>, run:
    <pre><code class="language-bash">agy plugin import gemini</code></pre>
  </li>
</ul>
See <a href="https://antigravity.google/docs/gcli-migration">Migrating from Gemini CLI</a> for details on plugins, context files (<code>GEMINI.md</code> / <code>AGENTS.md</code>), and MCP server config differences.

#### Antigravity 2.0 (IDE)

**1. Clone the Repo:**

```bash
git clone --branch 0.5.3 https://github.com/gemini-cli-extensions/knowledge-catalog.git
```

**2. Install the skills:**

Choose a location for the skills:

## Usage Examples

Interact with Knowledge Catalog using natural language:

* **Explore Catalog and Metadata:**
  * "Find all catalog entries related to 'customer orders'."
  * "Which columns look similar across marketing and sales datasets?"
  * "Show me the description and owner for the 'customer_pii' entry."

* **Perform Ad-hoc Analysis:**
  * "Calculate the total 'customer orders' this month."

## Supported Skills

The following skills are available in this repository:

- [Knowledge Catalog Discovery](./skills/knowledge-catalog-discovery/SKILL.md) - Use these skills when you need to discover and explore data assets in the Knowledge Catalog. It allows you to search for entries, lookup specific metadata, and explore aspect types to understand your data platform's assets.

## Additional Agent Skills

Find additional skills to support your entire software development lifecycle at [github.com/gemini-cli-extensions](https://github.com/gemini-cli-extensions).

## Troubleshooting

Use the debug mode of your agent (e.g., `gemini --debug`) to enable debugging.

Common issues:

* "failed to find default credentials: google: could not find default credentials.": Ensure [Application Default Credentials](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/gcloud) are available in your environment. See [Set up Application Default Credentials](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/external/set-up-adc) for more information.
* "✖ Error during discovery for server: MCP error -32000: Connection closed": The database connection has not been established. Ensure your configuration is set via environment variables.
* "✖ MCP ERROR: Error: spawn .../toolbox ENOENT": The Toolbox binary did not download correctly. Ensure you are using the latest version of your agent.
* "cannot execute binary file": The Toolbox binary did not download correctly. Ensure the correct binary for your OS/Architecture has been downloaded. See [Installing the server](https://mcp-toolbox.dev/documentation/introduction/#install-toolbox) for more information.
