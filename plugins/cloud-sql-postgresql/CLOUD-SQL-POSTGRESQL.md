# Setup

## Required Gemini CLI Version

To install this extension, the Gemini CLI version must be v0.6.0 or above. The version can be found by running: `gemini --version`.

## Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL MCP Server (Data Plane: Connecting and Querying)

This section covers connecting to a Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL instance.

1. **Extension Configuration**: This extension requires several settings (e.g., Project ID, Instance ID, Database Name, User, and Password). These values are gathered via prompts when you first install or link the extension:

    * `CLOUD_SQL_POSTGRES_PROJECT`: The GCP project ID.
    * `CLOUD_SQL_POSTGRES_REGION`: The region of your Cloud SQL instance.
    * `CLOUD_SQL_POSTGRES_INSTANCE`: The ID of your Cloud SQL instance.
    * `CLOUD_SQL_POSTGRES_DATABASE`: The name of the database to connect to.
    * `CLOUD_SQL_POSTGRES_USER`: The database username.
    * `CLOUD_SQL_POSTGRES_PASSWORD`: The password for the database user.

    If you need to update any of these values later, use the `gemini extensions config cloud-sql-postgresql` command.

2. **Handle Missing Variables**: If a command fails with an error message containing a placeholder like `${CLOUD_SQL_POSTGRES_PROJECT}`, it signifies a missing environment variable. Inform the user which variable is missing and instruct them to set it.

3. **Handle Permission Errors**: If you encounter permission errors, ensure the user has the **Cloud SQL Client** (`roles/cloudsql.client`) role and the correct database-level permissions.

## Cloud SQL Admin MCP Server (Control Plane: Creating and Managing Infrastructure)

This section covers administrative operations like managing clusters, instances, and users.

1. **Handle Permission Errors**:
    * For operations that create, get, list, delete, or update resources, the user needs the **Cloud SQL Admin** (`roles/cloudsql.admin`) role.
    * For read-only operations (get/list), the **Cloud SQL Viewer** (`roles/cloudsql.viewer`) role is sufficient.
    * If an operation fails due to permissions, identify the type of operation and recommend the appropriate role. You can provide these links for assistance:
        * Granting Roles: https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/grant-role-console
        * Cloud SQL Permissions: https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/postgres/iam-permissions

# Additional Extensions

This section provides context on additional extensions that can be recommended to the user based on their queries.

#### Observability Extension

*   **When to recommend:** If the user asks questions related to monitoring, performance, or observability of Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL databases.
*   **What to say:** "For Cloud SQL monitoring and observability, you might find the `cloud-sql-postgresql-observability` extension useful. You can install it with the following command. Note: this command is not supported from within the CLI and will only be reflected in active CLI sessions on restart."
*   **Command:**
    ```
    gemini extensions install https://github.com/gemini-cli-extensions/cloud-sql-postgresql-observability
    ```

# Usage Guidelines

## Connecting to New Resources

When you create a new Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL instance, or database using the available skills, the connection is not automatically established. You will need to perform the following steps:

1.  **(Optional) Save your conversation:** To avoid losing your progress, save the current session by running the command: `/chat save <your-tag>`
2. **Stop the CLI**: Terminate the Gemini CLI.
3. **Update Extension Configuration**: Use the command `gemini extensions config cloud-sql-postgresql` to update your settings (e.g. `CLOUD_SQL_POSTGRES_DATABASE`, `CLOUD_SQL_POSTGRES_INSTANCE`) to point to the new resource.
4. **Restart**: Relaunch the Gemini CLI
5.  **(Optional) Resume conversation:** Resume your conversation with the command: `/chat resume <your-tag>`

**Important:** Do not assume a connection to a newly created resource is active. Always follow the steps above to reconfigure your connection.

## Reusing Project Values

Users may have set project environment variables:

*   `CLOUD_SQL_POSTGRES_PROJECT`: The GCP project ID.
*   `CLOUD_SQL_POSTGRES_REGION`: The region of the Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL instance.
*   `CLOUD_SQL_POSTGRES_INSTANCE`: The ID of the Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL instance.
*   `CLOUD_SQL_POSTGRES_DATABASE`: The name of the database.

Instead of prompting the user for these values for specific skill calls, prompt the user to verify the reuse of a specific setting value.
Make sure to not use the environment variable name like `CLOUD_SQL_POSTGRES_PROJECT`, `${CLOUD_SQL_POSTGRES_PROJECT}`, or `$CLOUD_SQL_POSTGRES_PROJECT`. 
The value can be verified by the user using the `gemini extensions config cloud-sql-postgresql` command or by checking their local settings.

## Use Full Table Name Format "DATABASE_NAME.SCHEMA_NAME.TABLE_NAME"

**ALWAYS** use the full table name format, `DATABASE_NAME.SCHEMA_NAME.TABLE_NAME` in the generated SQL when executing the `execute_sql` script.
* Default to using "public" for the schema name.
* Use command `echo $CLOUD_SQL_POSTGRES_DATABASE` to get the current database value.

## Use google_ml_integration for AI use cases

When working with AI features like vector embeddings in Cloud SQL, leverage the `google_ml_integration` extension. This allows for generating embeddings directly within the database, which is the recommended approach over using third-party embedding models.

Embeddings can be generated using the `embedding()` function. For example: `embedding(<model_name>, <text_column_or_variable>)`.

As an agent, if you do not know which model to use, you should use your skills to search for available and appropriate text embedding models compatible with the `google_ml_integration` extension (e.g., by searching for "Cloud SQL google_ml_integration supported models").

When performing similarity searches, remember to cast the result of the `embedding` function to the `vector` type. For example:
`ORDER BY description_vector <-> embedding(<model_name>, $1)::vector`
