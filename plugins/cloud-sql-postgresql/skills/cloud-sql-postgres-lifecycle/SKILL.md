description: Use these skills when you need to manage the lifecycle of your instances, including performing backups and restores, checking major version upgrade compatibility, and monitoring overall instance status.

## Usage

All scripts can be executed using Node.js. Replace `<param_name>` and `<param_value>` with actual values.

**Bash:**
`node <skill_dir>/scripts/<script_name>.js '{"<param_name>": "<param_value>"}'`

**PowerShell:**
`node <skill_dir>/scripts/<script_name>.js '{\"<param_name>\": \"<param_value>\"}'`

Note: The scripts automatically load the environment variables from various .env files. Do not ask the user to set vars unless skill executions fails due to env var absence.
