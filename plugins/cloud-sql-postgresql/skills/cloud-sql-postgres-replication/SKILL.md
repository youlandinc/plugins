name: cloud-sql-postgres-replication
description: Use these skills when you need to monitor replication health, manage sync states between nodes, and audit database roles and security settings to ensure environment integrity.
---

## Usage

All scripts can be executed using Node.js. Replace `<param_name>` and `<param_value>` with actual values.

**Bash:**
`node <skill_dir>/scripts/<script_name>.js '{"<param_name>": "<param_value>"}'`

**PowerShell:**
`node <skill_dir>/scripts/<script_name>.js '{\"<param_name>\": \"<param_value>\"}'`

Note: The scripts automatically load the environment variables from various .env files. Do not ask the user to set vars unless skill executions fails due to env var absence.
