[![REUSE status](https://api.reuse.software/badge/github.com/cap-js/mcp-server)](https://api.reuse.software/info/github.com/cap-js/mcp-server)



## About This Project

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for the [SAP Cloud Application Programming Model (CAP)](https://cap.cloud.sap).
Use it for AI-assisted development of CAP applications (_agentic coding_).

The server helps AI models answer questions such as:
- _Which CDS services are in this project, and where are they served?_
- _What are the entities about and how do they relate?_
- _How do I add columns to a select statement in CAP Node.js?_

## Requirements

See [Getting Started](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/get-started) on how to jumpstart your development and grow as you go with SAP Cloud Application Programming Model.



## Setup

Configure your MCP client (Cline, opencode, Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, etc.) to start the server using the command `npx -y @cap-js/mcp-server` as in the following examples.

### Usage in VS Code

Example for VS Code extension [Cline](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=saoudrizwan.claude-dev):
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "cds-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@cap-js/mcp-server"],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
```

Example for VS Code global [mcp.json](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/customization/mcp-servers):
> Note: GitHub Copilot uses the `mcp.json` file as source for it's Agent mode.
```json
{
  "servers": {
    "cds-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@cap-js/mcp-server"],
      "env": {},
      "type": "stdio"
    },
    "inputs": []
  }
}
```

See [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/search?term=tag%3Aagent&target=VSCode&category=All%20categories&sortBy=Relevance) for more agent extensions.

### Usage in opencode

Example for [opencode](https://github.com/sst/opencode):
```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "cds-mcp": {
      "type": "local",
      "command": ["npx", "-y", "@cap-js/mcp-server"],
      "enabled": true
    }
  }
}
```

### Rules

The following rules help the LLM use the server correctly:

```markdown
- You MUST search for CDS definitions, like entities, fields and services (which include HTTP endpoints) with cds-mcp, only if it fails you MAY read \*.cds files in the project.
- You MUST search for CAP docs with cds-mcp EVERY TIME you create, modify CDS models or when using APIs or the `cds` CLI from CAP. Do NOT propose, suggest or make any changes without first checking it.
```

Add these rules to your existing global or project-specific [`AGENTS.md`](https://agents.md/) (specifics may vary based on respective MCP client).

### CLI Usage

You can also use the tools directly from the command line.

```sh
npm i -g @cap-js/mcp-server
```

This will provide the command `cds-mcp`, with which you can invoke the tools directly as follows.

```sh
# Search for CDS model definitions
cds-mcp search_model . Books entity

# Search CAP documentation
cds-mcp search_docs "how to add columns to a select statement in CAP Node.js" 1
```

## Available Tools

> [!NOTE]
> Tools are meant to be used by AI models and do not constitute a stable API.

The server provides these tools for CAP development:

### `search_model`

This tool performs fuzzy searches against names of definitions from the compiled CDS model (Core Schema Notation).
CDS compiles all your `.cds` files into a unified model representation that includes:
- All definitions and their relationships
- Annotations
- HTTP endpoints

The fuzzy search algorithm matches definition names and allows for partial matches, making it easy to find entities like "Books" even when searching for "book".

### `search_docs`

This tool uses vector embeddings to locally search through preprocessed CAP documentation, stored as embeddings. The process works as follows:

1. **Query processing:** Your search query is converted to an embedding vector.
2. **Similarity search:** The system finds documentation chunks with the highest semantic similarity to your query.

This semantic search approach enables you to find relevant documentation even when your query does not use the exact keywords found in the docs, all locally on your machine.
