## MCP Server

The plugin registers Resend's hosted [MCP server](https://github.com/resend/resend-mcp) at `https://mcp.resend.com/mcp` (streamable HTTP), giving agents tool access to the full Resend API. It authenticates via OAuth — your client walks you through sign-in on first connect, so no API key or header configuration is needed.
