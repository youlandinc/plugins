# Email Verifier

Check whether an email address is deliverable before you send to it.

## Examples

- `/hunter:email-verifier jane@stripe.com`
- `"Is john@acme.com a valid email?"`
- `"Check if sarah@notion.so is deliverable"`
- `"Verify these emails: a@x.com, b@y.com, c@z.com"`
- `"Can I send to hello@example.com?"`

## Steps

1. **Parse the input.** Extract the `email` address(es).

2. **Call `Email-Verifier`** for each email.

3. **Present the result with an actionable recommendation:**

```
# Verification: jane@stripe.com

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| **Status** | valid |
| **Score** | 91 |
| **MX Records** | Valid |
| **SMTP Check** | Valid |
| **Accept All** | No |
| **Disposable** | No |

## Recommendation
Safe to send. This email address is deliverable with high confidence.

## Next Actions
1. Find more contacts at stripe.com
2. Enrich this contact with personal details
```

4. **Interpret the result clearly** based on the `status` field:
   - **`valid`** (score 80+) -> "Safe to send. This email address is deliverable with high confidence."
   - **`accept_all`** -> "Proceed with caution. This mail server accepts all addresses, so delivery is not guaranteed even though SMTP checks pass."
   - **`unknown`** -> "Unable to determine deliverability. The mail server didn't respond clearly -- consider sending a low-priority test first."
   - **`invalid`** (score below 50) -> "Do not send. This address is likely invalid and will bounce."
   - **Disposable email** (`disposable: true`) -> Add: "This is a disposable/temporary email address. It may stop working at any time."
   - **Pending** (HTTP 202 response) -> "Verification is still in progress. Try again in a few seconds."

5. **For multiple emails,** verify each separately and present a summary:

```
# Verification Summary

| Email | Status | Score | Recommendation |
|-------|--------|-------|----------------|
| jane@stripe.com | valid | 91 | Safe to send |
| john@acme.com | accept_all | 62 | Proceed with caution |
| test@fake.com | invalid | 12 | Do not send |

**Results:** 1 valid, 1 accept_all, 1 invalid
```

## Credit Cost

Costs 1 verification credit per email — only charged for valid, invalid, or accept_all results.

## Success Criteria

Verification status returned with a clear, actionable recommendation the user can act on immediately.
