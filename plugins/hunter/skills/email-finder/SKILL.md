# Email Finder

Find the most likely email address for a person at a company using their name and domain.

## Examples

- `/hunter:email-finder Jane Smith at stripe.com`
- `/hunter:email-finder the CEO of notion.so`
- `"What's John Doe's email at acme.com?"`
- `"Find the email for Sarah Chen at Figma"`
- `"How can I reach Marc Benioff at Salesforce?"`

## Steps

1. **Parse the input.** Extract the person's `full_name` and the company `domain`.
   - "Jane Smith at Stripe" -> `full_name`: "Jane Smith", `domain`: "stripe.com"
   - If the user provides a company name instead of a domain, infer the likely domain (e.g., "Stripe" -> "stripe.com")
   - If only a role is given (e.g., "the CTO of Notion"), note that `Email-Finder` requires a name. Suggest using `Domain-Search` on the domain first to find the person's name, then come back to find their email.

2. **Call `Email-Finder`** with `full_name` and `domain`.

3. **Present the result:**

```
# Email Found: Jane Smith @ Stripe

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Email** | jane.smith@stripe.com |

   - Suggest checking the spelling of the name or trying a different domain variation.
