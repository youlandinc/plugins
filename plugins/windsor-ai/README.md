Connect Claude Code to 325+ business data sources. Query marketing, sales, CRM, finance, ecommerce, analytics, and more from Google Ads, Meta, TikTok, LinkedIn, GA4, HubSpot, Salesforce, Shopify, Stripe, QuickBooks, and hundreds more — directly from your terminal.

## What This Plugin Does

This plugin gives Claude Code access to your business data through [Windsor.ai](https://windsor.ai). Use it to:

- **Pull real data into your code** — seed dashboards, generate fixtures, build data pipelines
- **Explore your connected data sources** — see what platforms are connected and what fields are available
- **Generate types** — create TypeScript interfaces from your actual data schema
- **Get quick reports** — check performance metrics without leaving the terminal

## Installation

```bash
/plugin install windsor-ai@claude-plugin-directory
```

Or install from this repository:

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add https://github.com/windsorai/claude-code-plugin
claude plugin install windsor-ai
```

## Setup

After installing, you'll be prompted to authenticate with your Windsor.ai account via OAuth. This connects Claude Code to the same data sources you've set up in Windsor.ai.
