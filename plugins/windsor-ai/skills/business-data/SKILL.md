# Windsor.ai Business Data Skill

Use this skill whenever the user needs business data — marketing analytics, sales metrics, CRM data, ecommerce transactions, financial data, or any other data available through Windsor.ai's 325+ connectors.

## When to Use

- User is building a dashboard, report, or data visualization that needs business data from any source
- User asks about ad spend, campaign performance, ROAS, CTR, CPC, or conversion metrics
- User needs CRM, sales, ecommerce, or financial data in their codebase
- User needs to explore what data sources or fields are available
- User wants to seed a project with real data (e.g. for testing, prototyping, or generating fixtures)
- User is building an integration with any platform supported by Windsor.ai

## Available Tools

Windsor.ai provides 4 MCP tools:

### `get_connectors`
Lists all connected platforms and their account IDs. Always call this first if you don't know what accounts are available.

### `get_options`
Returns available fields, date filters, and options for a specific connector. Use this to discover what data can be queried before calling `get_data`.

**Parameters:**
- `connector` (required): Platform ID like `"google_ads"`, `"facebook"`, `"tiktok"`, `"linkedin"`, `"googleanalytics4"`, `"hubspot"`, `"salesforce"`, `"searchconsole"`, `"instagram"`, `"youtube"`, `"google_my_business"`, `"shopify"`, `"stripe"`, `"quickbooks"`, and 300+ more
- `accounts` (required): List of account IDs from `get_connectors`

### `get_fields`
Returns detailed metadata about specific fields — data types, descriptions, available values. Use this when you need to understand the schema before writing code that processes the data.

**Parameters:**
- `connector` (required): Platform ID
- `fields` (required): List of field IDs like `["campaign", "spend", "clicks"]`

### `get_data`
Retrieves actual data. This is the main query tool.

**Parameters:**
- `connector` (required): Platform ID
- `accounts` (required): List of account IDs
- `fields` (required): Fields to retrieve, e.g. `["campaign", "date", "spend", "clicks", "impressions"]`
- `date_from` / `date_to`: Date range as `"YYYY-MM-DD"`
- `date_preset`: Shorthand like `"last_7d"`, `"last_30d"`, `"this_month"`, `"last_3m"`
- `filters`: Conditions like `[["spend", "gt", 100], "and", ["campaign", "contains", "Sale"]]`
- `options`: Connector-specific options like `{"attribution_window": "7d_view,1d_click"}`

## Workflow Pattern

1. **Discover** → Call `get_connectors` to see what's connected
2. **Explore** → Call `get_options` to see available fields for a connector
3. **Understand** → Call `get_fields` for field metadata if building typed interfaces
4. **Query** → Call `get_data` to pull the actual data

## Common Field Patterns

Fields vary by connector type. Here are some common examples:

**Marketing/Ads connectors:** `campaign`, `adgroup`, `ad`, `date`, `device`, `country`, `spend`, `clicks`, `impressions`, `conversions`, `revenue`, `ctr`, `cpc`, `cpm`, `roas`

**CRM connectors:** `deal`, `contact`, `company`, `stage`, `owner`, `amount`, `close_date`

**Ecommerce connectors:** `order_id`, `product`, `quantity`, `price`, `customer`, `status`

Always check `get_options` first since available fields vary by connector.

## Tips

- When building dashboards or charts, pull data with `get_data` and write it to a local JSON/CSV file the app can read
- For TypeScript projects, use `get_fields` to generate accurate type definitions
- Use `date_preset` for quick queries: `"last_7d"`, `"last_30d"`, `"this_month"`
- Combine filters for focused queries: `[["spend", "gt", 0], "and", ["campaign", "ncontains", "test"]]`
- You can join data from different connectors (e.g. ad spend + CRM revenue) by pulling from each and merging in code
