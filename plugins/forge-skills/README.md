# Atlassian Forge Skills

Atlassian Forge lets you build and deploy apps directly on the Atlassian platform - issue panels, Confluence macros, dashboard gadgets, and more. The Forge Skills Plugin bundles several Forge-focused skills plus MCP-backed tooling so your agent can scaffold apps, review them before deploy, debug production issues, and stay current on Forge APIs and the Atlassian Design System.

## What's included

### Skills

The plugin ships multiple skills under `skills/`, each with a `SKILL.md` the host can load:

**Forge App Builder** (`skills/forge-app-builder/`) guides scaffolding through production: `forge create`, dev spaces and templates, deploy and install, module selection, cross-product scopes, and common CLI or permission issues.

**Forge App Review** (`skills/forge-app-review/`) supports pre-deploy review and audits: security, architecture, cost and invocation efficiency, performance, and trigger or scheduling waste.

**Forge Cost Optimizer** (`skills/forge-cost-optimizer/`) helps reduce Forge platform consumption across invocations, storage, logs, memory, triggers, API calls, and frontend/backend boundaries.

**Forge Debugger** (`skills/forge-debugger/`) supports systematic troubleshooting when something breaks: `forge` / deploy errors, resolver failures, blank or missing UI, scopes and permissions, and apps that “stopped working” in Jira or Confluence.

**Forge Connector** (`skills/forge-connector/`) guides building `graph:connector` apps that ingest external data into Atlassian's Teamwork Graph, making it searchable in Rovo Search and surfaced in Rovo Chat.

**Forge Security Review** (`skills/forge-security-review/`) performs white-box Forge app security audits with rule-driven checks for authz, injection, tenant isolation, secrets handling, egress/remotes, web triggers, and optional static-analysis workflows.

### Forge MCP Server

Gives your agent access to up-to-date Forge documentation, template registries, module configuration, manifest syntax, and UI Kit/backend API guides -- so its knowledge stays current rather than relying on training data.

### ADS MCP Server

Provides Atlassian Design System lookup for Custom UI apps: component discovery, token reference, and icon search via the `@atlaskit` library.

| **Forge Cost Optimizer skill**  | Reduce Forge platform consumption and avoid waste         | Invocations, storage writes, logs, memory, triggers                    |
| **Forge Debugger skill**        | Diagnose deploy, runtime, UI, and permission issues       | Logs, blank panels, resolver errors, missing app in UI                 |
| **Forge Connector skill**       | Ingest external data into Teamwork Graph / Rovo           | graph:connector, setObjects, Rovo Search, Rovo Chat                    |
| **Forge Security Review skill** | White-box security audits and exploitability reporting    | AuthZ bypasses, injection, tenant isolation, static analysis workflows |
| **Forge MCP Server**            | Live Forge documentation and tooling                      | Template lookup, manifest syntax, UI Kit guides, backend API reference |

## Prerequisites

Before you install, make sure you have:

- An [Atlassian account](https://id.atlassian.com)
- **Node.js 22+** (`node -v`) — required for Forge CLI and app builds
- **Python 3** available on your PATH (used by helper scripts)

## Install

### Claude Code

```
/plugin install forge-skills@atlassian-forge-skills
```

### Cursor

The Forge Skills plugin can be installed directly from the [Cursor Marketplace](https://cursor.com/marketplace/atlassian/forge-skills)

Or by running the following command in chat with a Cursor agent:

```
/add-plugin forge-skills
```

### Gemini CLI

```bash
gemini extensions install https://github.com/atlassian/forge-skills
```

### GitHub Copilot CLI

```bash
copilot plugin install atlassian/forge-skills
```

### OpenAI Codex

Install the Forge Skills marketplace:

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add atlassian/forge-skills --ref main
```

Then install the plugin:

```bash
codex plugin add forge-skills@atlassian-forge-skills
```

Start a new Codex thread after installing so the Forge skills and MCP servers are loaded.

To refresh the marketplace after updates:

```bash
codex plugin marketplace upgrade atlassian-forge-skills
codex plugin add forge-skills@atlassian-forge-skills
```

### Rovo Dev

Rovo Dev doesn't currently support plugin installations but you can install the skills and MCP servers separately.

Install the skills:

```bash
npx skills add atlassian/forge-skills
```

Then run `acli rovodev mcp` to edit your MCP configuration in your default editor. Add the details from `.mcp.json`.

Restart Rovo Dev for the skills and MCP to be available.

## Verify the installation

After install, try four quick checks.

### 1. Verify the skill layer

Ask:

> Build me a Jira issue panel that shows customer support tickets.

You should get a structured Forge workflow: developer space discovery, template selection, `forge create`, code customization, and deployment -- not just generic code snippets.

Optionally confirm the other skills are available:

- **Review:** e.g. “Review my Forge app for security and unnecessary trigger invocations before I deploy.”
- **Debug:** e.g. “My Forge issue panel is blank after deploy -- help me trace it.”
- **Security:** e.g. “Run a white-box security review on this Forge app and include CVSS-scored findings.”

### 2. Verify Forge MCP

Ask:

> What Forge templates are available for Confluence macros?

You should get a tool-backed response from the Forge documentation, not a hallucinated list.

### 3. Verify ADS MCP (Custom UI only)

Ask:

> What Atlaskit components should I use for a data table?

You should get a response backed by the Atlassian Design System, with specific component names and import paths.

### 4. Verify Forge Connector skill

Ask:

> I want to ingest data from an external project management tool into Rovo Search using a Forge connector app. Where do I start?

You should get a structured walkthrough covering `graph:connector` app setup, `setObjects` ingestion, required scopes, and how the data surfaces in Rovo Search and Rovo Chat -- not a generic Forge tutorial.

## Prompts to try

Once the plugin is installed, try prompts like these:

- `Create a Jira issue panel that shows related support tickets from an external API.`
- `Build a Confluence macro that embeds an interactive chart with bar, line, and pie options.`
- `Add a Jira dashboard gadget that summarizes open issues grouped by priority.`
- `Create a Confluence macro that reads Jira issues assigned to me and displays them in a table.`
- `My forge create keeps failing with "Prompts can not be meaningfully rendered" -- help!`
- `Deploy my Forge app to my staging site.`
- `What scopes do I need for a Confluence app that also reads Jira data?`
- `Review my Forge app for cost and security before production.`
- `Run a white-box security audit of this Forge app and focus on authz bypass and web trigger abuse.`
- `forge deploy fails with [error] -- what should I check?`

## Authentication

The Forge CLI handles authentication:

```bash
forge login
```

You will be prompted for your Atlassian email and an [API token](https://id.atlassian.com/manage/api-tokens). Enter credentials only in your terminal -- never paste tokens into chat.

Verify you are logged in:

```bash
forge whoami
```

## Troubleshooting

### The agent is not using Forge skills

- Make sure the plugin installed successfully in your host
- Confirm the `skills/` directory includes `forge-app-builder`, `forge-app-review`, `forge-debugger`, `forge-connector`, and `forge-security-review` (each with a `SKILL.md` where applicable)
- Reload or restart your host so it re-indexes plugins and MCP configuration

### MCP tools are not showing up

- Check that the Forge MCP entries were added for your host
- Restart MCP servers or reload the host after configuration changes
- Verify Node.js is installed (`node -v`)

### Forge commands fail with auth errors

- Re-run `forge login`
- Create a new API token at [id.atlassian.com/manage/api-tokens](https://id.atlassian.com/manage/api-tokens)
- Make sure the correct developer space is selected

### forge create fails

- **"Prompts can not be meaningfully rendered"**: Run `forge create` in an interactive terminal
- **"No developer spaces found"**: Create one at [developer.atlassian.com/console](https://developer.atlassian.com/console/)
- **"forge: command not found"**: `npm install -g @forge/cli`
