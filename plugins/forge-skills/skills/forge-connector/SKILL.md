# Forge Connector

Builds a `graph:connector` Forge app that ingests external data into Atlassian's Teamwork Graph so it appears in **Rovo Search** and **Rovo Chat**.

## Critical Rules

1. **Must install in Jira** — Apps using Teamwork Graph modules must be installed on a Jira site. Confluence-only installs will not work.
2. **Never ask for credentials in chat** — Direct users to run `forge login` in their own terminal.
3. **Always run the scaffold script yourself** — Do not only give manual instructions; run `scripts/scaffold_connector.py` to generate the boilerplate.
4. **Always ask the user for their Atlassian site URL** when install is needed — never discover or guess it.
5. **Atlassian deletes data on disconnect** — When `action = 'DELETED'`, the app only needs to clean up local state; Atlassian removes the Teamwork Graph data automatically.
6. **Handler arguments are passed directly** — Forge passes the request object as the first argument to handlers, NOT nested under `event.payload`. Config values are at `request.configProperties`, NOT `event.payload.config`. This is the most common source of `TypeError: Cannot destructure property of undefined` errors.
7. **Use `@forge/kvs` for storage** — Import `kvs` from `@forge/kvs`. Do NOT use `@forge/storage` — its `storage` export is `undefined` at runtime in connector functions.
8. **Use `graph` named export from `@forge/teamwork-graph`** — The correct import is `const { graph } = require('@forge/teamwork-graph')`. Call `graph.setObjects({ objects, connectionId })`. Do NOT import `setObjects` as a named export directly.
9. **`validateConnectionHandler` must return `{ success, message }`** — Do NOT throw an Error. Return `{ success: false, message: '...' }` to reject, `{ success: true }` to accept.
10. **`function` declarations belong under `modules`** — In `manifest.yml`, `function:` is a key under `modules:`, not a top-level key. Placing it at the top level causes a lint error.
11. **`formConfiguration` uses `form` array with `type: header`** — Do NOT use `fields:` or `beforeYouBegin:`. The correct format uses `form: [{ key, type: header, title, description, properties: [...] }]`.
12. **Scopes are `read/write/delete:object:jira`** — Use `read:object:jira`, `write:object:jira`, `delete:object:jira`. The scopes `read:graph:teamwork` and `write:graph:teamwork` are invalid and will fail `forge lint`.
13. **Set `ATL_FORGE_ATTRIBUTION_SKILL_NAME=forge-connector` on `forge` commands run for this skill** — prefix `forge` invocations with this env var: ones you run in the shell (e.g. `forge lint`, `forge logs`, `forge deploy`) **and the interactive `forge create` command you hand the user as a fallback**. The bundled scripts set it automatically; other commands shown in this skill omit it for brevity — add it when you run them. The only exclusions are `forge login` and `forge tunnel` (user-run auth / live-dev commands).

## Agent Workflow — Complete Steps 0–7 in Order

### Step 0: Prerequisites

Check Node.js (`node -v`, requires 22+), Forge CLI (`forge --version`), and login (`forge whoami`). Install missing tools:

```bash
npm install -g @forge/cli
```

Tell the user to run `forge login` in their terminal if not authenticated.

### Step 1: Discover Developer Spaces

> **Note:** `forge developer-spaces list` does NOT exist in Forge CLI 12.x. You cannot list developer spaces non-interactively.

`forge create` requires an interactive TTY to select a developer space. Ask the user to run it themselves:

```
Tell the user:
  cd <parent-directory>
  ATL_FORGE_ATTRIBUTION_SKILL_NAME=forge-connector forge create --template blank <app-name>

  When prompted, select a Developer Space and let it complete.
  Come back when done.
```

The `--dev-space-id` flag in the scaffold script is optional and can be omitted — the script has been updated to skip it when not provided.

### Step 1.5: Discover Data & Map to Object Types

**Do this before scaffolding.** Ask the user the following questions to determine the correct Teamwork Graph object type(s). Do not assume or default to `atlassian:document`.

#### Questions to ask the user

1. **What external system or tool are you connecting?**
   e.g. Google Drive, ServiceNow, Salesforce, GitHub, Confluence, Slack, Figma, Zendesk

2. **What kind of content do you want to make searchable in Rovo?**
   Prompt with examples to help them identify it:
   - Files, pages, wiki articles, reports, PDFs → likely `atlassian:document`
   - Tasks, tickets, issues, bugs, stories → likely `atlassian:work-item`
   - Chat messages, emails, comments → likely `atlassian:message` or `atlassian:comment`
   - Projects, workspaces, boards → likely `atlassian:project`
   - Code repositories → likely `atlassian:repository`
   - Pull requests / merge requests → likely `atlassian:pull-request`
   - Git commits → likely `atlassian:commit`
   - Design files (Figma, Sketch) → likely `atlassian:design`
   - Video recordings → likely `atlassian:video`
   - Calendar events, meetings → likely `atlassian:calendar-event`
   - Threads, channels → likely `atlassian:conversation`
   - Customer accounts or organisations → likely `atlassian:customer-organization`
   - Team spaces or org units → likely `atlassian:space`

3. **Is the content a single type or a mix?**
   If mixed (e.g. a project management tool with tasks *and* documents), plan to ingest each as its own object type. The scaffold supports one primary type — you can add more `objectTypes` entries in `manifest.yml` later.

4. **Does the admin need to supply credentials (API key, URL, OAuth token) to connect?**
   Yes → use `--has-form-config` in the scaffold command.
   No (data comes entirely from within Atlassian) → omit the flag.

5. **How often does the source data change?**
   Frequently (hourly) → plan a `scheduledTrigger` with `interval: hour`.
   Daily or less → `interval: day`.
   Static / one-off → no scheduled trigger needed.

6. **Who should be able to see the ingested content in Rovo Search?**
   This determines the `permissions.accessControls` on each object. Ask:
   - "Is all this content publicly accessible, or does the source system restrict who can see what?"
   - "Do you want Rovo Search results to respect those source-system permissions?"

   Map the answer to the correct principal model:

   | Source system access model | `accessControls` to use |
   |---|---|
   | Publicly accessible, no restrictions | `principals: [{ type: 'EVERYONE' }]` |
   | Specific named users have access | `principals: [{ type: 'user', id: '<atlassian-account-id>' }]` — one entry per user |
   | Team or group based (e.g. Confluence space, Google Workspace group) | `principals: [{ type: 'group', id: '<group-id>' }]` — one entry per group |
   | Private / owner only | single `user` principal with the owner's Atlassian account ID |
   | Mixed (per-object ACLs from the source) | fetch ACLs per item during ingestion and map each to a `user` or `group` principal |

   **Do NOT default to `EVERYONE`** unless the user explicitly confirms content is publicly accessible. Using `EVERYONE` on restricted content leaks data to users who shouldn't see it in Rovo Search.

   Record the chosen permission model before proceeding to Step 2. Reference it when writing the `setObjects` call in Step 3.

#### Mapping decision

Based on the answers, select the best-fit type from the Object Types table below. Only fall back to `atlassian:document` if the content genuinely has no better match (e.g. arbitrary file attachments). For types marked ❌ in the "Indexed in Rovo" column (`atlassian:build`, `atlassian:deployment`, `atlassian:test`), warn the user that those objects will not appear in Rovo Search or Rovo Chat.

Record the chosen object type(s) and permission model before proceeding to Step 2.

### Step 2: Scaffold the Connector App

Run from the **skill directory** (the directory containing this SKILL.md). Replace `<object-type>` with the type determined in Step 1.5. `--dev-space-id` is optional:

```bash
python3 -m scripts.scaffold_connector \
  --name <app-name> \
  --connector-name "<Human Readable Name>" \
  --object-type <object-type> \
  --directory <parent-directory>
```

Add `--dev-space-id <id>` only if you have the ID from a previous step.

**Object type** — use the type chosen in Step 1.5. Do NOT default to `atlassian:document` without first completing the discovery questions above.

**Form config flag** — add `--has-form-config` if the admin must provide API credentials or connection details (determined in Step 1.5 question 4). Omit it for apps that operate entirely within Atlassian (no external credentials needed).

> **If scaffold fails because `forge create` needs a TTY:** The scaffold script will print a manual fallback command. Have the user run `forge create` interactively, then continue from Step 3 — the scaffold script only needs to write `manifest.yml` and `src/index.js` after the directory exists.

### Step 3: Customize the Generated Code

After scaffolding (or after the user runs `forge create` interactively):

```bash
cd <app-name>
npm install
```

The blank template generates `src/index.js` (JavaScript, not TypeScript). Edit it to add your API calls. The scaffold generates working handler skeletons; fill in your business logic.

#### Key files to edit

| File           | What to change                                                          |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `src/index.js` | `fetchExternalData()` — replace with your API calls                     |
| `manifest.yml` | Add `permissions.external.fetch.backend` URLs for any external APIs     |
| `package.json` | Add `@forge/api`, `@forge/kvs`, `@forge/teamwork-graph` as dependencies |


#### setObjects — ingest data into Teamwork Graph

Use the `graph` named export — do NOT destructure `setObjects` directly:

```javascript
const { graph } = require('@forge/teamwork-graph');

const result = await graph.setObjects({
  connectionId,          // required — the connectionId from the handler request
  objects: [
    {
      schemaVersion: '1.0',
      id: 'unique-id-from-source',      // unique per connectionId
      updateSequenceNumber: 1,
      displayName: 'My Document Title',
      url: 'https://source-system.example.com/doc/123',
      createdAt: '2024-01-15T10:00:00Z',        // ISO 8601
      lastUpdatedAt: '2024-01-20T14:30:00Z',
      // Use the permission model chosen in Step 1.5 question 6.
      // EVERYONE only if content is confirmed publicly accessible.
      // For user-restricted content: { type: 'user', id: '<atlassian-account-id>' }
      // For group-restricted content: { type: 'group', id: '<group-id>' }
      permissions: [{
        accessControls: [{
          principals: [{ type: 'EVERYONE' }],
        }],
      }],
      'atlassian:document': {
        type: {
          category: 'DOCUMENT',   // see Document Categories table below
          mimeType: 'application/vnd.google-apps.document',
        },
        content: {
          mimeType: 'application/vnd.google-apps.document',
          text: 'document title or snippet for search indexing',
        },
      },
    },
  ],
});

if (!result.success) {
  console.error('setObjects error:', result.error);
}
```

- Max **100 objects per call** — batch large datasets with a loop
- `id` must be unique per `connectionId`
- `connectionId` is required in every `graph.setObjects()` call

#### Document Categories (for `atlassian:document.type.category`)

| MIME type | Category |
|---|---|
| `application/vnd.google-apps.document` | `DOCUMENT` |
| `application/vnd.google-apps.spreadsheet` | `SPREADSHEET` |
| `application/vnd.google-apps.presentation` | `PRESENTATION` |
| `application/vnd.google-apps.folder` | `FOLDER` |
| `application/pdf` | `PDF` |
| `image/*` | `IMAGE` |
| `video/*` | `VIDEO` |
| `audio/*` | `AUDIO` |
| Other | `OTHER` |

#### getObjectByExternalId — look up a single object

```javascript
const { graph } = require('@forge/teamwork-graph');

const data = await graph.getObjectByExternalId({
  externalId: 'unique-id-from-source',
  objectType: 'atlassian:document',
  connectionId,
});
if (data.success) console.log(data.object);
```

### Step 4: Deploy and Install

**You MUST run the deploy script** — do not only give the user manual `forge deploy` commands.

The deploy script lives in the **forge-app-builder** skill, not in this skill. Derive its directory from the path of this SKILL.md: go up two levels (`skills/forge-connector/` → `skills/`) then into `forge-app-builder/`. Run all commands below from that directory.

```bash
# Derive forge-app-builder skill dir from this SKILL.md's path:
# e.g. if this file is at /path/to/skills/forge-connector/SKILL.md
# then the deploy script dir is: /path/to/skills/forge-app-builder/

# If you have the site URL:
python3 -m scripts.deploy_forge_app \
  --app-dir <app-directory> \
  --site <site-url> \
  --product jira

# If you don't have the site URL yet, deploy first then ask:
python3 -m scripts.deploy_forge_app \
  --app-dir <app-directory> \
  --product jira \
  --deploy-only
# Ask: "What is your Atlassian site URL (e.g. yourcompany.atlassian.net)?"
python3 -m scripts.deploy_forge_app \
  --app-dir <app-directory> \
  --site <site-url> \
  --product jira \
  --skip-deps
```

### Step 5: Connect via Atlassian Administration

After deployment, tell the user to:

1. Go to **Atlassian Administration** → **Apps** → **[site]** → **Connected apps**
2. Find the app → **View app details** → **Connections** tab
3. Click **Connect** under the connector
4. Fill in any configuration fields (if `formConfiguration` was defined)
5. Click **Connect** — this triggers `onConnectionChange` with `action: CREATED` and starts data ingestion

### Step 6: Monitor with forge tunnel

Use `forge tunnel` during development to stream live logs directly to your terminal as the connector functions execute. This is the fastest way to catch errors in `onConnectionChangeHandler`, `validateConnectionHandler`, and `setObjects` calls without waiting for `forge logs`.

Tell the user to run this in their own terminal (it requires an interactive session):

```bash
cd <app-directory>
forge tunnel
```

With the tunnel active, any invocation of the connector functions (e.g. clicking "Connect" in Atlassian Admin, or triggering a scheduled re-ingestion) will stream output immediately. Look for:

- `[connector] Fetched N items` — confirms `fetchExternalData()` ran
- `[connector] Batch 1: N accepted, 0 rejected` — confirms `setObjects` succeeded
- Any uncaught errors or thrown exceptions from `validateConnectionHandler`

If the tunnel is not running, use `forge logs` instead to inspect past invocations:

```bash
# Most recent 50 log lines from development environment
forge logs -e development --limit 50

# Production logs for a specific site
forge logs -e production --site <your-site> --limit 50
```

**Tunnel vs logs — when to use which:**

| Situation | Use |
|---|---|
| Actively developing / testing the connection flow | `forge tunnel` — live streaming |
| Debugging a past invocation or production issue | `forge logs` |
| Connector function timed out before tunnel caught it | `forge logs` with `--limit 100` |

> **Note:** `forge tunnel` must be run by the user in an interactive terminal — do not attempt to run it via the agent.

### Step 7: End-to-End Verification (optional)

Before running any checks, ask the user:

> "Would you like to run end-to-end verification checks before deploying to production? This confirms the connection, ingestion, Rovo Search visibility, and permission boundaries are all working correctly."

If the user says **no** or wants to skip, move on — do not run or describe the checks.
If the user says **yes**, work through every check below in order.

#### Check 1 — Connection established

In **Atlassian Administration → Apps → Connected apps**, the connector should show status **Connected**. If it shows an error or pending state, go back to Step 6 and inspect `forge tunnel` or `forge logs` output.

#### Check 2 — `validateConnection` passed (if configured)

If the app has a `validateConnection` function, confirm the admin saw a success message when clicking **Connect**. If not, check logs for the return value — it must be `{ success: true }`, not a thrown error.

#### Check 3 — `onConnectionChange` fired and ingestion ran

In `forge logs` or the tunnel output, confirm:

```bash
forge logs -e development --limit 50
```

Look for all three signals:
- Handler was invoked: log line from `onConnectionChangeHandler` with `action: CREATED`
- Data was fetched: e.g. `[connector] Fetched N items`
- `setObjects` succeeded: e.g. `[connector] Batch 1: N accepted, 0 rejected`

If `setObjects` returned `{ success: false }`, the error detail is in `result.error` — surface it to the user and fix before continuing.

#### Check 4 — Objects visible in Rovo Search

1. Open Rovo Search on the Jira site (allow up to **5 minutes** for indexing after ingestion)
2. Search for a word that appears in at least one ingested object's `displayName` or content text
3. Filter by the connector's nickname (set by admin at connection time)

At least one result from the connector should appear. If nothing shows up after 5 minutes:
- Confirm `setObjects` logged `N accepted` with N > 0 (Check 3)
- Confirm the object's `permissions` match the logged-in user (an `EVERYONE` principal or a `user`/`group` principal that includes the test user)
- Re-check that `write:object:jira` scope is present in `manifest.yml` and the app was redeployed after any scope change

#### Check 5 — Permission boundary (skip only if `EVERYONE` was used)

If the connector uses `user` or `group` principals:
1. Log in as a user who **should** have access → confirm the object appears in Rovo Search
2. Log in as a user who **should not** have access → confirm the object does **not** appear

If a restricted object is visible to an unauthorised user, re-check the `accessControls` principals in `setObjects` and redeploy.

#### Check 6 — Rovo Chat references connector data

Ask Rovo Chat a question whose answer exists only in the ingested content, e.g.:

> "What is the status of [title of an ingested item]?"

Rovo Chat should cite the connector as a source. If it cannot find the content, Checks 3 and 4 likely have an unresolved issue.

#### Check 7 — Scheduled re-ingestion fires (if configured)

If a `scheduledTrigger` was added:
1. Temporarily set `interval: fiveMinutes` in `manifest.yml`, redeploy, and wait one cycle
2. Confirm `forge logs` shows a fresh ingestion run from `refreshIngestionHandler`
3. Restore the original interval and redeploy before going to production

#### Production readiness gate

If the user chose to run verification, only proceed to a production deploy (`forge deploy -e production`) when **all applicable checks above pass**:

| Check | Required for production |
|---|---|
| 1 — Connection established | Always |
| 2 — validateConnection passed | Only if `validateConnection` is configured |
| 3 — Ingestion ran without errors | Always |
| 4 — Objects visible in Rovo Search | Always |
| 5 — Permission boundary | Only if using `user`/`group` principals |
| 6 — Rovo Chat cites connector | Always |
| 7 — Scheduled re-ingestion fires | Only if `scheduledTrigger` is configured |

## Manifest Reference

> **Key rules:**
> - Scopes are `read:object:jira`, `write:object:jira`, `delete:object:jira` — NOT `read:graph:teamwork` / `write:graph:teamwork` (those fail `forge lint`)
> - `function:` is declared **under `modules:`**, not at the top level
> - Egress uses `address:` not a bare string (run `forge lint --fix` to auto-correct)
> - `formConfiguration` uses `form: [{ type: header, properties: [...] }]` — NOT `fields:` or `beforeYouBegin:`

### Minimal connector (no admin config, no OAuth)

Use when the app operates entirely within Atlassian — no external credentials needed.

```yaml
app:
  id: <generated-by-forge-create>
  runtime:
    name: nodejs24.x
    memoryMB: 256
    architecture: arm64

permissions:
  scopes:
    - read:object:jira
    - write:object:jira
    - delete:object:jira
    - storage:app

modules:
  graph:connector:
    - key: my-connector
      name: My Service
      icons:
        light: https://cdn.example.com/logo.png
        dark: https://cdn.example.com/logo.png
      objectTypes:
        - atlassian:document
      datasource:
        onConnectionChange:
          function: on-connection-change

  function:
    - key: on-connection-change
      handler: index.onConnectionChangeHandler
```

### Connector with admin form config (API key / URL)

Use when the admin must provide credentials to connect to an external system.

```yaml
app:
  id: <generated-by-forge-create>
  runtime:
    name: nodejs24.x
    memoryMB: 256
    architecture: arm64

permissions:
  scopes:
    - read:object:jira
    - write:object:jira
    - delete:object:jira
    - storage:app
  external:
    fetch:
      backend:
        - address: 'https://api.your-service.com'   # note: address: not a bare string

modules:
  graph:connector:
    - key: my-connector
      name: My Service
      icons:
        light: https://cdn.example.com/logo.png
        dark: https://cdn.example.com/logo.png
      objectTypes:
        - atlassian:document
      datasource:
        formConfiguration:
          form:                          # use form:, NOT fields: or beforeYouBegin:
            - key: connectionDetails
              type: header
              title: Connection Details
              description: >
                Provide your My Service API credentials.
                Find them in My Service → Settings → API.
              properties:
                - key: apiKey           # camelCase keys — accessed as request.configProperties.apiKey
                  label: API Key
                  type: string
                  isRequired: true
                - key: apiUrl
                  label: API URL
                  type: string
                  isRequired: true
          validateConnection:
            function: validate-connection
        onConnectionChange:
          function: on-connection-change

  function:                              # function: is under modules:, NOT top-level
    - key: on-connection-change
      handler: index.onConnectionChangeHandler
    - key: validate-connection
      handler: index.validateConnectionHandler
```

## Handler Signatures

> **Critical:** Forge passes the request **directly as the first argument** — it is NOT wrapped under `event.payload`. Config form values are at `request.configProperties`, not `event.payload.config`. Getting this wrong causes `TypeError: Cannot destructure property of undefined`.

### onConnectionChange

```javascript
const { kvs } = require('@forge/kvs');
const { graph } = require('@forge/teamwork-graph');

exports.onConnectionChangeHandler = async (request) => {
  // request.action, request.connectionId, request.configProperties
  const { action, connectionId, configProperties } = request;

  if (action === 'DELETED') {
    // Atlassian removes Teamwork Graph data automatically on disconnect.
    // Only clean up locally stored credentials.
    await kvs.deleteSecret(connectionId);
    return { success: true };
  }

  // CREATED or UPDATED — persist credentials and ingest data
  await kvs.setSecret(connectionId, configProperties);
  await ingestAllData(connectionId, configProperties);
  return { success: true };
};
```

### validateConnection

```javascript
const { fetch } = require('@forge/api');

exports.validateConnectionHandler = async (request) => {
  // request.configProperties — NOT event.payload.config
  const { configProperties } = request;

  // Return { success: false, message } to reject — do NOT throw an Error.
  // Return { success: true } to accept.
  const response = await fetch(`${configProperties['apiUrl']}/health`);
  if (!response.ok) {
    return { success: false, message: 'Invalid API credentials. Please check your settings.' };
  }
  return { success: true, message: 'Connection validated successfully.' };
};
```

### refreshIngestion (scheduled trigger)

```javascript
exports.refreshIngestionHandler = async () => {
  const activeConnections = await kvs.get('active-connections') ?? [];
  for (const connectionId of activeConnections) {
    const config = await kvs.getSecret(connectionId);
    if (config) await ingestAllData(connectionId, config);
  }
};
```

## Object Types

Objects in **bold** are indexed in Rovo Search and Rovo Chat.


| Object Type                       | Indexed in Rovo | Best for                             |
| --------------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `atlassian:document`              | ✅               | Files, pages, wiki articles, reports |

## Rovo Search / Rovo Chat Surfacing

Once ingested:

- Objects appear in **Rovo Search** under a subfilter named after the connector's nickname (set by admin at connection time)
- **Rovo Chat** can reference and cite connector objects in responses when queried about topics related to the ingested content
- Data is not available immediately — allow a few minutes for indexing after `onConnectionChange` fires

To verify ingestion is working:

1. Open Rovo Search on the Jira site
2. Search for text that appears in an ingested object's `name` or `properties`
3. Filter by the connector nickname to narrow results

---

## Batching Pattern for Large Datasets

```javascript
const { graph } = require('@forge/teamwork-graph');

const BATCH_SIZE = 100;

async function ingestAllData(connectionId, config) {
  const items = await fetchExternalData(config);

  for (let i = 0; i < items.length; i += BATCH_SIZE) {
    const batch = items.slice(i, i + BATCH_SIZE);
    const result = await graph.setObjects({
      connectionId,          // required in every call
      objects: batch.map(item => ({
        schemaVersion: '1.0',
        id: item.id,                      // unique per connectionId
        updateSequenceNumber: 1,
        displayName: item.title,
        url: item.url,
        createdAt: item.createdAt,
        lastUpdatedAt: item.updatedAt,
        // Replace with user/group principals if source system has access controls.
        permissions: [{
          accessControls: [{ principals: [{ type: 'EVERYONE' }] }],
        }],
        'atlassian:document': {
          type: { category: 'DOCUMENT', mimeType: item.mimeType },
          content: { mimeType: item.mimeType, text: item.title },
        },
      })),
    });
    if (!result.success) {
      console.error(`[connector] setObjects error in batch ${Math.floor(i / BATCH_SIZE) + 1}:`, result.error);
    }
  }
}
```

---

## Scheduled Re-Ingestion (optional)

To keep data fresh, add a scheduled trigger that re-runs ingestion periodically:

```yaml
# In manifest.yml — under modules:
scheduledTrigger:
  - key: refresh-trigger
    function: refresh-ingestion
    interval: day   # prefer 'day' or 'hour'; avoid 'fiveMinutes'

# Under function:
  - key: refresh-ingestion
    handler: index.refreshIngestionHandler
```

```javascript
const { kvs } = require('@forge/kvs');

// Track active connections in onConnectionChangeHandler:
//   await kvs.set('active-connections', [...activeConnections, connectionId]);
//   await kvs.setSecret(connectionId, configProperties);  // store credentials securely

exports.refreshIngestionHandler = async () => {
  const activeConnections = await kvs.get('active-connections') ?? [];
  for (const connectionId of activeConnections) {
    const config = await kvs.getSecret(connectionId);  // retrieve stored credentials
    if (config) await ingestAllData(connectionId, config);
  }
};
```

## Scripts


| Script                          | Skill directory                                   | Purpose                                                                                                                         |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `scripts/scaffold_connector.py` | `skills/forge-connector/` (this skill)            | Scaffold a new connector app — generates manifest.yml, src/index.ts, installs SDK. Run: `python3 -m scripts.scaffold_connector` |
| `scripts/deploy_forge_app.py`   | `skills/forge-app-builder/` (**different skill**) | Deploy and install on Jira. Run from the forge-app-builder directory: `python3 -m scripts.deploy_forge_app`                     |


The scaffold script is in this skill's directory. The deploy script is in the **forge-app-builder** skill directory — always `cd` there (or derive the path from this SKILL.md's location) before running it.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `graph:connector` not recognized in manifest | Run `forge lint` — it will identify the exact field causing the error |
| `TypeError: Cannot destructure property 'config' of 'event.payload'` | Handler using `event.payload.config` — change to `request.configProperties`. Forge passes request directly, not nested under `event.payload` |
| `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'set')` | Using `storage` from `@forge/storage` — switch to `kvs` from `@forge/kvs` |
| `graph.setObjects is not a function` | Wrong import — use `const { graph } = require('@forge/teamwork-graph')` then call `graph.setObjects({ objects, connectionId })` |
| `forge lint`: invalid scopes `read/write:graph:teamwork` | Replace with `read:object:jira`, `write:object:jira`, `delete:object:jira` |
| `forge lint`: `document should NOT have additional property 'function'` | `function:` is at the top level — move it inside `modules:` |
| `forge lint`: `formConfiguration must have required property 'form'` | Replace `fields:` / `beforeYouBegin:` with `form: [{ type: header, properties: [...] }]` |
| `forge lint` warning: deprecated egress entries | Run `forge lint --fix` to auto-convert bare URL strings to `{ address: 'url' }` |
| `forge developer-spaces list` command not found | Does not exist in Forge CLI 12.x. Have user run `forge create` interactively to select a developer space |
| `forge create` fails with non-TTY error | `forge create` needs an interactive terminal — ask the user to run it; then write manifest and source files into the created directory |
| `onConnectionChange` not triggered | Verify admin clicked "Connect" in Atlassian Administration → Connected apps; run `forge tunnel` to confirm the function fires |
| Objects not appearing in Rovo Search | Wait ~5 minutes for indexing; run `forge logs -e development --since 15m` to check for `setObjects` errors |
| 403 on `@forge/teamwork-graph` calls | Ensure `read:object:jira`, `write:object:jira`, `delete:object:jira` are in manifest scopes, then redeploy and `forge install --upgrade` |
| `forge login` required | Create API token at https://id.atlassian.com/manage/api-tokens, then run `forge login` |

## Naming and Logo Guidelines

- Use the **official service name** as the connector name (e.g. `Google Drive`, not `Drive Connector by Acme`)
- Use the **official service logo** for icons — do not modify or combine with your own branding
- These guidelines apply only to the `graph:connector` module; your Forge app itself may use your own branding
