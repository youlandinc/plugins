description: Get a digest of recent activity across multiple Slack channels
---

Given the comma-separated channel names provided in $ARGUMENTS (strip leading `#` and whitespace from each):

1. Parse the argument into individual channel names. Strip leading `#` and whitespace from each name.

2. For each channel:
   a. Use `slack_search_channels` to find the channel ID.
   b. Use `slack_read_channel` to read recent messages (use a limit of 50 messages per channel to keep things manageable).
   c. Summarize the key activity in that channel: main topics, decisions, questions, and notable messages.

3. Present the digest in this format:

   ```text
   **Channel Digest — <today's date>**

   **#channel-1**
   - Summary point 1
   - Summary point 2

   **#channel-2**
   - Summary point 1
   - Summary point 2

   ...
   ```

4. For each channel, keep the summary to 3-5 bullet points maximum. Focus on what's actionable or noteworthy.

5. If a channel has no recent activity, note that it's been quiet and mention when the last message was posted (if visible).

6. If a channel name can't be found, let the user know and continue with the remaining channels.
