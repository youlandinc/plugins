# Reachability Check

Two-stage probe to confirm `SCAN_TARGET_URL` is reachable before configuring
the scan. Run immediately after `SCAN_TARGET_URL` is confirmed. If the check
completes (passes or the user chooses "Continue anyway"), return to the calling
workflow and proceed. If the user cancels, stop.

---

**Stage 1** — probe the base URL:

```bash
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" --max-time 5 <SCAN_TARGET_URL>/
```

- **2xx, 3xx, 401, 403, or 405** → API is reachable. Proceed silently.
- **Connection refused or timeout** → call `AskUserQuestion`:
  - **question**: `"I couldn't reach <SCAN_TARGET_URL> — the connection timed out or was refused. How would you like to proceed?"`
  - **options**: `["Try a different URL", "Continue anyway — the API may be temporarily down", "Cancel"]`
  - If **Try a different URL** → ask for new URL, store as `SCAN_TARGET_URL`, re-run from Stage 1.
  - If **Continue anyway** → proceed with warning noted.
  - If **Cancel** → stop.
- **404** → ambiguous (server may be up but nothing is mounted at root). Proceed to Stage 2.

---

**Stage 2** — probe the first simple OAS path (only reached when Stage 1 returns 404):

Find the first `GET` path in the OAS that has no required path parameters. Strip
any `{param}`-style segments and probe:

```bash
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" --max-time 5 <SCAN_TARGET_URL><first_simple_path>
```

- **Any HTTP response** → server is up; root just has no handler. Proceed silently.
- **Connection refused or timeout** → same `AskUserQuestion` as Stage 1.
- **404 again** → call `AskUserQuestion`:
  - **question**: `"The server responded but both / and <path> returned 404 — the base URL may be incorrect (the API may be mounted at a different prefix). How would you like to proceed?"`
  - **options**: `["Try a different URL", "Continue anyway", "Cancel"]`
  - If **Try a different URL** → ask for new URL, store as `SCAN_TARGET_URL`, re-run from Stage 1.
  - If **Continue anyway** → proceed with warning noted.
  - If **Cancel** → stop.
