  Run both a 42Crunch Audit and a live Scan together in a single pipeline.
  Use this skill when the user wants to run audit and scan together, complete
  the full security pipeline, or when the request is ambiguous about which
  phase to run. Triggers on phrases like "run audit and scan", "full 42crunch
  pipeline", "full security check", "audit then scan", "42crunch", or "SQG".
  Do NOT use this skill if the user explicitly requests only an audit (use
  42crunch-audit) or only a scan (use 42crunch-scan).

# 42Crunch API Security Skill

Orchestrates two phases: **Audit** (static OAS analysis and SQG fix loop) and
**Scan** (live conformance + authorization testing). Each phase requires
explicit user permission before execution.

---

## Entry Point

1. **Pre-flight checks.** Read `../../references/pre-flight.md` and complete
   all steps (setup, OAS resolution, tag detection). When prompting for OAS
   file selection, use the context `"pipeline"` (e.g. "Which one should I run
   through the pipeline?"). Do not proceed if any step fails or the user cancels.

2. **Ask for Phase 1 permission.** Call `AskUserQuestion`:
   - **question**: `"Ready to run a 42Crunch Audit on <filename>. This will analyse your OAS file and produce a scored report. Shall I proceed?"`
   - **options**: `["Yes, proceed", "No, cancel"]`

3. **Execute Phase 1 — Audit.** Mode is already resolved from pre-flight — do
   not re-derive it. Read `../../references/audit-workflow.md` and apply only
   the commands for the identified mode throughout.
   The workflow runs the audit, then presents a **developer-readable,
   risk-classified report** (SQG-Blocking / Security / Data Validation / Spec
   Conformance tiers) with plain-English titles and risk descriptions — no
   raw rule IDs. It then pauses and asks the user to consent before applying
   any fixes. Fixes are only applied after explicit confirmation.

4. **Resolve the scan target URL.**

   Read `servers[0].url` from the OAS file.

   - If `SCAN42C_HOST` environment variable is set → announce silently:
     > "Using scan target from SCAN42C_HOST: `<url>`"
     Store as `SCAN_TARGET_URL` and proceed.
   - If not set → call `AskUserQuestion`:
     - **question**: `"The OAS points to <servers[0].url> as the API target. Is this the right URL to scan against?"` — options: `["Yes — use this URL", "No — I'll provide a different URL"]`
     - If **No** → ask the user to provide the URL and store it as `SCAN_TARGET_URL`.
     - If **Yes** → store `servers[0].url` as `SCAN_TARGET_URL`.

5. **OAS analysis for Phase 2 preview** — run silently after Phase 1 completes,
   before asking for Phase 2 permission.

   Read the OAS file and collect:
   - Total operation count
   - Auth scheme types from `securitySchemes` (Bearer/JWT, API Key, Basic, OAuth2)
   - BOLA candidate count: operations that reference a specific existing resource by a client-supplied id/key/ref — in a **path** parameter (`{…Id}`, `{…Key}`, `{…Ref}`), a **query** parameter (`?orderId=`), or a **request-body field** (`POST /lookup {orderId}`, `POST /transfer {fromAccountId, toAccountId}`). Method does not gate candidacy; only pure collection or create-new operations are excluded
   - Whether the OAS contains sample data: any operation with `example`, `examples`, or `default` values on its request body or parameter schemas

   Carry these results forward — `scan-workflow.md` reuses them in its auth
   setup, test-data, and classification steps instead of re-reading the OAS.

6. **Ask for Phase 2 permission.** Output the following scan preview as a chat
   message first:

   ```
   Ready to configure the scan?
     Target:   <SCAN_TARGET_URL>
     OAS:      <filename>  (<N> operations)
     Auth:     <scheme types>  [+  second user needed — <N> BOLA candidate(s)]
     Samples:  OAS has sample data  /  No samples — you'll need to provide test data
     Tag:      <category>:<tagname>           ← platform mode only, when a tag is assigned; omit if no tag
     Mode:     Platform / Token
   ```

   Then call `AskUserQuestion`:
   - **question**: `"I'm ready to start configuring the scan. I'll ask for credentials, classify your operations, and set up test scenarios — then run a happy path validation before the full scan. Shall I proceed?"`
   - **options**: `["Yes, let's configure", "No, cancel"]`

7. **Execute Phase 2 — Scan.** Mode is already resolved from pre-flight — do
   not re-derive it.

   **Reachability check** — read `../../references/reachability-check.md` and run
   the two-stage probe now. Return here once it completes (or stop if the user cancels).

   Read `../../references/scan-workflow.md` and apply only
   the commands for the identified mode throughout.
   The workflow sets up the scan config, collects credentials, gathers test data,
   shows a complete operation-by-operation classification table, validates happy paths,
   then asks for permission again before running the full scan. It presents a **risk-classified findings report**
   (Authorization failures / SQG-blocking conformance / informational conformance).
   Fix candidates are determined by SQG-blocking rules and authorization failures — not severity alone.
   The skill pauses and asks the user to consent before applying any OAS changes or server-side code fixes.
   Optionally prompt user to restart the API after server-side code fixes are applied,
   or skipped, before the final scan summary.

  **Mandatory checkpoint:** during Phase 2, after any direct edit to
  `CONF_FILE` (including `environments.default.variables.*`, auth wiring, or
  scenario chains), run `scan conf validate` and resolve all validation
  errors before continuing to happy-path or full scan runs.

8. **Present the final combined summary** (see Output Format below).

9. **Recommend next steps** based on the outcome:

    **If both phases passed and fixes were applied:**
    > "Both audit and scan are passing. Your OAS is more precise and your
    > security contract is enforced. Consider committing the updated OAS file
    > and rerunning `42crunch-api-security-testing` after any significant API change."

    **If either phase failed or the user declined fixes:**
    > "Here's what's still open: [list remaining SQG-failing issues or unfixed
    > scan findings by tier]. When you're ready to address them, run
    > `42crunch-audit` or `42crunch-scan` individually."

    **If no issues were found in either phase:**
    > "Clean result — your API passed both static analysis and live testing.
    > This is a good baseline to maintain."

Only continue after explicit user confirmation at each permission prompt.

## Output Format

After both phases complete, produce a summary in this shape:

```
Phase 1 — Audit Complete
  Score:          <score> / 100  (Security: <sec-score> · Data Validation: <data-score>)
  Score change:   <initial-score> → <score>  (<delta>)  |  Data: <initial-data> → <data-score>  (<data-delta>)   ← omit if no fixes applied
  Mode:           Platform                          ← or "Token"
  SQG:            PASSED  (<sqg-name> — your org's security quality gate is met)     ← platform mode, passed
  SQG:            FAILED  (<sqg-name> — the quality gate is not met; fixes above are required)    ← platform mode, failed
  SQG:            N/A  (Token mode — no automated gate; user-defined thresholds applied this session)    ← token mode
  Tag:            <category>:<tagname>              ← platform mode only, when a tag is assigned; omit this row if no tag
  Issues fixed:   2 SQG-blocking  (0 security · 2 data validation)
  OAS updated:    <path/to/openapi.json>

Phase 2 — Scan Complete
  Mode:           Platform                          ← or "Token"
  SQG:            PASSED  (<sqg-name> — your org's security quality gate is met)    ← platform mode, passed
  SQG:            FAILED  (<sqg-name> — the quality gate is not met; fixes above are required)    ← platform mode, failed
  SQG:            N/A  (Token mode — scan findings are informational; no gate enforced)    ← token mode
  Authorization:  BOLA confirmed on 1 operation — OAS updated · server-side fix applied
  Conformance:    1 SQG-blocking issue fixed (OAS + code) · 3 informational findings surfaced
  OAS updated:    <path/to/openapi.json>

```

Show only the one SQG line per phase that matches the current mode and result.

The `Score change:` row in Phase 1 is produced from the delta values computed in
Step 4 of `../../references/audit-workflow.md`. Omit it when no audit fixes were
applied (user declined at the consent gate, or there were no SQG-blocking issues).

If a phase was skipped (user declined), note that instead of its results.

## Environment Variables

| Variable       | Purpose |
|----------------|---------|
| `SCAN42C_HOST` | Scan target base URL (overrides OAS `servers[0]`) — Both modes |

All other variables (`API_KEY`, `PLATFORM_HOST`, `TRIAL_TOKEN`) and general
constraints are defined in `../../references/pre-flight.md`.
