# Netlify MCP Servers

An MCP server exposes **tools** (and optionally resources/prompts) that an AI client — Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Cursor — can call. On Netlify, a remote MCP server is just **one Netlify Function** that speaks the MCP protocol over HTTP. This skill gets you a working, secure server and connects a client to it.

**"Netlify MCP" means two different things — make sure you're building the right one.** Netlify publishes its *own* hosted MCP server that lets an AI client operate the **Netlify platform** on your behalf — create projects, trigger deploys, manage env vars and infrastructure through your Netlify account. You don't write that one; you point your client at Netlify's hosted MCP server per Netlify's MCP-server docs (and see the **netlify-agent-runner** skill for running agents against your site). This skill is the *other* thing: building **your own** MCP server — an endpoint that exposes *your* app's tools and data to an agent — hosted on a Netlify Function. If the ask is "let my agent manage my Netlify sites/deploys/env vars," that's the hosted Netlify MCP server, not a function you write.

The same setup works two ways:

- **Standalone server** — a repo whose only job is the MCP endpoint (e.g. wrapping a third-party API).
- **Added to an existing app** — one more function alongside your site. Have its tools call the **same service/data layer your UI and REST routes already use**, so logic isn't duplicated.

## Before you build

Decide one thing up front, because it shapes the auth code:

- **Who calls this server?** Just you (a personal/single-user server) → use a **single shared secret**. Multiple people, each acting as themselves → use **per-user API keys** backed by Netlify Identity. See [authentication](references/authentication.md).

If you're not sure, start with the single shared secret — it's a few lines and you can layer per-user keys on later. I'll default to that unless you say otherwise.

## Stack

Use the official MCP SDK with its Web-standard Streamable HTTP transport, running statelessly inside a Netlify Function.

```bash
npm install @modelcontextprotocol/sdk zod
```

A Netlify Function already speaks the web platform — it receives a `Request` and returns a `Response`. The SDK ships a transport built on exactly those primitives, `WebStandardStreamableHTTPServerTransport` (the same core the SDK runs on internally, and what Cloudflare Workers / Deno / Bun use): you hand it the `Request` and return the `Response` it produces — no adapter, no version pin. Older guides reach for the Node-flavored `StreamableHTTPServerTransport` plus a `fetch-to-node` bridge to synthesize the Node `req`/`res` objects it expects; on Netlify you need neither, and skipping them is both simpler and what's verified to work here.

One gotcha, independent of all this: the transport returns **HTTP 406** to any POST whose `Accept` header lacks *both* `application/json` and `text/event-stream`. That's an MCP-spec requirement the *client* must satisfy — a 406 means fix the client's `Accept` header, not the server. Letting the SDK own the protocol also means you don't hand-maintain JSON-RPC framing or the protocol-version handshake.

## The server function

With the Web-standard transport this is a few lines — most of what older guides show was the Node bridge, which you don't need. Put it in `netlify/functions/mcp.ts`:

```typescript
import type { Config, Context } from "@netlify/functions";
import { McpServer } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/mcp.js";
import { WebStandardStreamableHTTPServerTransport } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/webStandardStreamableHttp.js";
import { z } from "zod";
import { checkBearer } from "../lib/mcp/bearer"; // see Authentication

function buildServer() {
  const server = new McpServer({ name: "my-mcp", version: "0.1.0" });

  server.tool(
    "get_item",
    "Fetch a single item by id. Read-only.",
    { id: z.string().describe("The item's unique id") },
    async ({ id }) => ({
      content: [{ type: "text", text: JSON.stringify(await getItem(id)) }],
    }),
  );

  return server;
}

export default async (req: Request, _context: Context) => {
  if (!checkBearer(req)) return new Response("Unauthorized", { status: 401 });

  // Stateless JSON server: it only does request/response over POST. Reject other
  // methods — a GET makes the transport open an SSE stream that never closes, which
  // a serverless function can't serve (you'll get a 502).
  if (req.method !== "POST") return new Response("Method not allowed", { status: 405 });

  // Fresh server + transport per request, no session to persist. enableJsonResponse
  // returns one application/json body instead of an SSE stream — the right fit here.
  const server = buildServer();
  const transport = new WebStandardStreamableHTTPServerTransport({
    sessionIdGenerator: undefined,
    enableJsonResponse: true,
  });

  // Hand over the Web Request, return the Web Response. The transport owns JSON-RPC
  // framing, body parsing (a malformed body comes back as a clean 400), and the handshake.
  await server.connect(transport);
  return transport.handleRequest(req);
};

export const config: Config = { path: "/mcp" };
```

That's a complete, deployable server. Everything else is tools, auth, and safety.

## Browser-based clients and CORS

Netlify Functions do **not** add CORS headers for you, and the server above returns 405 to every non-POST method — including the `OPTIONS` preflight a browser sends. That's fine for the normal case: native MCP clients (Claude Code, Cursor, Claude Desktop, the `mcp-remote` bridge) are **not** browsers and don't enforce the same-origin policy, so they need no CORS at all — which is why those clients work while a browser call doesn't.

It only matters when your MCP client runs **in a browser** — a web app calling the server cross-origin. Then the browser blocks the request unless the response carries `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`, and it first sends an `OPTIONS` preflight that must come back `2xx` with `Access-Control-Allow-Methods` (including `POST`) and `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` (including `Authorization` and `Content-Type`). A "blocked by CORS policy: No Access-Control-Allow-Origin header" error in the browser console is this — not a broken server or a platform bug. Answer the preflight in the function itself, **before** the 405 check, and echo the CORS headers on the POST response too:

```typescript
const CORS = {
  "Access-Control-Allow-Origin": Netlify.env.get("MCP_ALLOWED_ORIGIN") ?? "*",
  "Access-Control-Allow-Methods": "POST, OPTIONS",
  "Access-Control-Allow-Headers": "Authorization, Content-Type, Mcp-Session-Id",
};

// In the handler, before the 405 check:
if (req.method === "OPTIONS") return new Response(null, { status: 204, headers: CORS });
// ...then reject other non-POST methods with 405, and add CORS to the transport's Response.
```

The function must set these headers itself — don't treat a browser CORS error as something to escalate to Netlify or route around by loosening auth.

## Defining tools

Each tool is a `name`, a one-line `description`, a `zod` input schema, and a handler that returns `{ content: [...] }`. The description and parameter `.describe()` text are the only thing the model sees — write them like API docs for an agent: say what the tool does, when to use it, and call out anything irreversible.

As the count grows, give each tool its own module and register them in `buildServer()`. Servers with many tools often keep a registry (an array of `{ name, description, inputSchema, handler }`) and wire `tools/list` + `tools/call` once — the transport setup above is identical either way.

## Authentication

The MCP client must prove it's allowed to call your server. Every request carries `Authorization: Bearer <token>`; reject anything else with a 401.

**Single shared secret** (personal / single-user). One env var, compared in constant time. Put this in `netlify/lib/mcp/bearer.ts`:

```typescript
import { timingSafeEqual } from "node:crypto";

export function checkBearer(req: Request): boolean {
  const expected = Netlify.env.get("MCP_BEARER_TOKEN");
  if (!expected) return false;
  const match = req.headers.get("authorization")?.match(/^Bearer\s+(.+)$/i);
  if (!match) return false;
  const a = Buffer.from(match[1]);
  const b = Buffer.from(expected);
  // Length check first because timingSafeEqual throws (RangeError) on unequal-length
  // buffers. The token is fixed-length, so the early return leaks nothing useful.
  return a.length === b.length && timingSafeEqual(a, b);
}
```

Generate the token with `openssl rand -hex 32` and store it as a secret env var.

**Per-user API keys** (multi-user). Netlify Identity gates a web UI where each user mints their own keys; you store only a **hash** of each key (never the plaintext) tied to that user, resolve the key to a user on every request, and flow that user into your tool handlers so tools act as the right person. Full pattern — schema, generation, hashing, revocation, resolving the user — in [authentication](references/authentication.md).

## Safety and permissions

Tools are a public API handed to an autonomous agent. Be deliberate:

- **Expose the least that does the job.** Separate reads from writes, and think hard before exposing destructive tools. A common, sound choice is to **omit delete tools entirely** and keep destructive actions in a human-operated UI.
- **Guard irreversible or public actions** by putting explicit instructions in the tool's description — e.g. "show the user the exact text and get confirmation before posting." This is a soft, model-level guard, so back it with a real kill switch: a token you can revoke instantly.
- **Keep the client's credential separate from your backend's.** The client authenticates to your server (bearer/API key); your server authenticates to the database or third-party API with its *own* secret. Never pass your backend god-key out to the client.
- **Use least-privilege backend credentials** — app passwords or scoped tokens, not account-level ones, so a leak is contained and revocable.
- **Validate inputs** (your `zod` schemas do this) and **log every tool call** so you can see what the agent did — `console.info` shows up in Netlify function logs.

## Rate limiting

An MCP server is a public endpoint an autonomous agent can hit in a tight loop — cap it. Netlify Functions have **built-in declarative rate limiting**, so don't hand-roll a counter (a per-instance in-memory counter wouldn't hold across function instances anyway — see the next section). Add a `rateLimit` block to the function's `config` export:

```typescript
export const config: Config = {
  path: "/mcp",
  rateLimit: {
    windowSize: 60,               // time window in seconds; capped at 180
    windowLimit: 100,             // max requests per window
    aggregateBy: ["ip", "domain"], // group by ip, domain, or both
  },
};
```

Over the limit the platform returns HTTP `429` by default (or set `action: "rewrite"` with a `to` path to send excess traffic to a dedicated page). Function rate limits live **only** in the function's `config` export — they **cannot** be defined in `netlify.toml`.

## File uploads

When a tool needs the agent to supply a file (an image to post, a doc to attach), don't push the bytes through the tool call as base64 — it bloats the model's context and runs into payload limits. Instead hand the agent a short-lived, single-use **presigned URL** to `PUT` the raw bytes to, store them in **Netlify Blobs**, and reference the file by a stable key from your other tools. Sign the URL with an **HMAC** (over the upload id, content-type, size, and expiry) keyed by a secret env var and verify it in constant time — the signature *is* the authorization, so the `PUT` carries no bearer token. On the upload endpoint, enforce the declared content-type and size and reject replays. Full three-step flow (`prepare_upload` → `PUT` → `finalize_upload`) with code: [file uploads](references/file-uploads.md).

## State doesn't survive between requests

Every request builds a fresh server and transport, and any invocation may land on a **different** — or cold-started — function instance. Module-level memory is not shared between instances and not durable across cold starts. So state you need to persist between calls **cannot** live in a module-scoped `Set`/`Map`/variable: single-use / replay tracking for the presigned uploads above, idempotency keys, "already processed this id" guards, per-user counters you track by hand. An in-memory guard *looks* correct locally and on one warm instance, then silently lets a replayed upload through (or double-processes a call) the moment another instance serves the request. Keep that state in a **durable store** — Netlify Blobs or your database — keyed by the upload/request id, and check-and-mark it there. (This is also why the server itself runs stateless, with `sessionIdGenerator: undefined`.)

## Connecting a client

Native remote-MCP support is now the norm; reach for the `mcp-remote` bridge only as a fallback.

- **Claude Code** — `claude mcp add --transport http my-mcp https://<site>.netlify.app/mcp --header "Authorization: Bearer <token>"`
- **Cursor** — add the server to `mcp.json` with the URL and an `Authorization` header.
- **Claude Desktop / claude.ai** — add a **Custom Connector** (Settings → Connectors). Connectors are OAuth-oriented; for a static-bearer server the `mcp-remote` bridge is the reliable path.
- **Fallback (older / stdio-only clients)** — `npx mcp-remote https://<site>.netlify.app/mcp --header "Authorization: Bearer <token>"`

Full client matrix and the OAuth / Custom Connector deep-dive: [connecting clients](references/connecting-clients.md).

## Local dev and deploy

- **Run it:** `netlify dev` serves the function at `http://localhost:8888/mcp`.
- **Test it:** the MCP Inspector — `npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector` — connect via Streamable HTTP to your URL with an `Authorization: Bearer` header and list/call tools. Or point `claude mcp add --transport http` at the localhost URL.
- **Identity caveat:** Netlify Identity does **not** work under `netlify dev`, so per-user-key auth must be tested on a deploy preview. See the **netlify-identity** skill.
- **Deploy:** push to Git, or `netlify deploy --build --prod`.
- **Secrets:** set tokens/keys as env vars (`netlify env:set MCP_BEARER_TOKEN <value> --secret`) — never in code.

## Cross-cutting rules

- Never hardcode secrets. Store tokens, API keys, and signing secrets as Netlify environment variables (mark them secret). Beyond the leak risk, a bearer token or signing secret written into source (or any file the build publishes) trips **Netlify's secrets scanning and fails the deploy** even after an otherwise-green build — the fix is to move it to a secret env var and read it at runtime with `Netlify.env.get(...)`, and rotate the token if it was committed, *not* to disable the scanner. See **netlify-deploy** for the scan controls.
- Inside functions, read env vars with `Netlify.env.get("VAR")`, not `process.env`.
- Add `.netlify` to `.gitignore`.
