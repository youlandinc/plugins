# Analyzing Range Distribution

Analyzes CockroachDB range distribution, leaseholder placement, and zone configuration compliance using `SHOW RANGES` and `SHOW ZONE CONFIGURATIONS` commands. Identifies range count anomalies, size imbalances, leaseholder hotspots, and replication issues - entirely via SQL without requiring DB Console access.

**Complement to profiling skills:** This skill analyzes range-level data distribution; for query performance patterns, see [profiling-statement-fingerprints](../profiling-statement-fingerprints/SKILL.md). For schema change storage planning, see [analyzing-schema-change-storage-risk](../analyzing-schema-change-storage-risk/SKILL.md).

## When to Use This Skill

- Identify tables/indexes with excessive range counts indicating fragmentation
- Detect range size imbalances or uneven data distribution across nodes
- Investigate leaseholder concentration causing read hotspots
- Validate zone configuration effects on range placement and replica distribution
- Diagnose range-level replication issues (under-replicated or unavailable ranges)
- Analyze range split patterns from high write volume
- SQL-only range analysis without DB Console access

**For schema change planning:** Use [analyzing-schema-change-storage-risk](../analyzing-schema-change-storage-risk/SKILL.md) to estimate storage requirements before CREATE INDEX or ADD COLUMN operations.

## Prerequisites

- SQL connection to CockroachDB cluster
- Admin role OR `ZONECONFIG` system privilege
- Understanding of CockroachDB range architecture (default 512MB max size; verify with `SHOW ZONE CONFIGURATION FOR RANGE default`)
- Knowledge of cluster topology (node IDs, regions, availability zones)

**Check your privileges:**
```sql
SHOW SYSTEM GRANTS FOR <username>;  -- Should show admin or ZONECONFIG
```

See [permissions reference](references/permissions.md) for RBAC setup.

## Core Concepts

### Ranges: Units of Data Distribution

**Range:** Contiguous key space segment (default 512MB max size, configurable via zone config `range_max_bytes`)
**Raft group:** Each range replicated across nodes (default 3 replicas)
**Leaseholder:** Single replica handling reads and coordinating writes for a range

**Critical:** Ranges split automatically at `range_max_bytes` (default 512MB), but can fragment further due to load-based splitting during high write traffic.

### Leaseholders and Hotspots

**Leaseholder concentration:** Single node holding disproportionate leaseholders = read hotspot
**Load-based splitting:** CockroachDB splits ranges experiencing high QPS, increasing range count
**Hotspot symptoms:** High CPU on single node, slow reads on specific table/index

### Range Fragmentation

**Fragmentation:** Excessive range splits creating many small ranges (overhead from Raft coordination)
**Causes:** High write throughput, sequential inserts (timestamp-based primary keys), load-based splitting
**Symptoms:** High range count relative to data size, increased latency from Raft overhead

**Fragmentation metric:** Ranges per GB. With the 512MB default `range_max_bytes`, a fully-grown range covers 0.5 GB — so ~2 ranges/GB is the natural floor. Anything well above that (e.g., 10+ ranges/GB) suggests load-based splits or many small ranges; tune to your workload.

### Zone Configurations

**Zone config:** Replication and placement policies for databases, tables, or indexes
**Replication factor:** Number of replicas per range (default: 3)
**Constraints:** Node placement rules (region, availability zone, node attributes)

**Use case:** Validate intended zone config matches actual range placement.

### SHOW RANGES DETAILS Option

**CRITICAL SAFETY WARNING:** The `WITH DETAILS` option computes `span_stats` (range size, key counts) on-demand, causing:
- **High CPU usage** from statistics computation
- **Memory overhead** proportional to range count
- **Query timeouts** on large tables without LIMIT

**Best practice:** Always use `LIMIT` with `DETAILS`, target specific tables/indexes, avoid cluster-wide scans.

## Core Diagnostic Queries

### Query 1: Range Count by Table (Production-Safe)

```sql
SELECT
  table_name,
  index_name,
  COUNT(*) AS range_count
FROM [SHOW RANGES FROM TABLE your_table_name]
GROUP BY table_name, index_name
ORDER BY range_count DESC;
```

**Interpretation:** High range count (1000s) on small tables indicates fragmentation. Cross-reference with table size.

**Safety:** No `DETAILS` option = production-safe, minimal overhead.

### Query 2: Range Size Analysis (Targeted DETAILS)

```sql
SELECT
  range_id,
  start_key,
  end_key,
  (span_stats->>'approximate_disk_bytes')::INT / 1048576 AS size_mb,
  lease_holder,
  replicas
FROM [SHOW RANGES FROM TABLE your_table_name WITH DETAILS]
ORDER BY (span_stats->>'approximate_disk_bytes')::INT DESC
LIMIT 50;
```

**Interpretation:** Ranges close to or above `range_max_bytes` (default 512MB) indicate split lag; many small ranges (<10MB) indicate fragmentation.

**CRITICAL:** Always include `LIMIT` and target specific tables. Never run `SHOW RANGES WITH DETAILS` on entire database.

### Query 3: Leaseholder Distribution (Hotspot Detection)

```sql
SELECT
  lease_holder,
  COUNT(*) AS leaseholder_count,
  ROUND(COUNT(*) * 100.0 / SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER (), 2) AS percentage
FROM [SHOW RANGES FROM TABLE your_table_name]
GROUP BY lease_holder
ORDER BY leaseholder_count DESC;
```

**Interpretation:** >40% leaseholders on single node in balanced cluster = hotspot. Check if table has zone constraints favoring specific nodes.

**Remediation:** Use `ALTER TABLE ... CONFIGURE ZONE USING lease_preferences` to spread leaseholders.

### Query 4: Range Replication Health Check

```sql
SELECT
  range_id,
  start_key,
  replicas,
  array_length(replicas, 1) AS replica_count,
  voting_replicas,
  array_length(voting_replicas, 1) AS voting_replica_count,
  lease_holder
FROM [SHOW RANGES FROM TABLE your_table_name]
WHERE array_length(replicas, 1) < 3  -- Under-replicated
ORDER BY range_id
LIMIT 100;
```

**Interpretation:** `replica_count < 3` = under-replicated (data loss risk). Check for node failures, decommissioning operations, or zone config mismatches.

**Safety:** No `DETAILS` = production-safe.

### Query 5: Zone Configuration Audit

```sql
SHOW ZONE CONFIGURATIONS;
```

**Output columns:**
- `target`: Database, table, or index
- `raw_config_sql`: Zone config SQL (replication factor, constraints)

**Use case:** Validate intended replication factor and placement constraints match expected design.

**Cross-reference:** Compare zone configs with Query 3 (leaseholder distribution) and Query 4 (replica health) to validate actual placement.

### Query 6: Fragmentation Analysis (Ranges per GB)

```sql
WITH range_counts AS (
  SELECT
    table_name,
    index_name,
    COUNT(*) AS range_count
  FROM [SHOW RANGES FROM TABLE your_table_name]
  GROUP BY table_name, index_name
),
table_sizes AS (
  SELECT
    table_name,
    SUM((span_stats->>'approximate_disk_bytes')::INT) / 1073741824.0 AS size_gb
  FROM [SHOW RANGES FROM TABLE your_table_name WITH DETAILS]
  GROUP BY table_name
)
SELECT
  rc.table_name,
  rc.index_name,
  rc.range_count,
  ts.size_gb,
  ROUND(rc.range_count / NULLIF(ts.size_gb, 0), 2) AS ranges_per_gb
FROM range_counts rc
JOIN table_sizes ts ON rc.table_name = ts.table_name
ORDER BY ranges_per_gb DESC;
```

**Interpretation:**
- **Healthy:** 1-15 ranges/GB
- **Moderate fragmentation:** 16-50 ranges/GB
- **Severe fragmentation:** 50+ ranges/GB

**CRITICAL:** This query uses `DETAILS` - only run on targeted tables with known size, never cluster-wide.

**Remediation:** Increase `range_max_bytes` via zone config (with caution), or accept fragmentation if caused by necessary load-based splitting.

See [sql-queries reference](references/sql-queries.md) for complete query variations and guardrails.

## Common Workflows

### Workflow 1: Hotspot Investigation

**Scenario:** Single node experiencing high CPU, slow reads on specific table.

**Steps:**
1. **Identify leaseholder concentration:** Run Query 3 on suspected table
2. **Validate zone config:** Run Query 5 to check lease_preferences
3. **Check for load-based splits:** Run Query 1 to detect recent range fragmentation (symptom of hotspot)
4. **Remediate:** Configure lease preferences to spread reads, or partition table if hotspot is on sequential key range

**Example:**
```sql
-- Check leaseholder distribution
SELECT lease_holder, COUNT(*) FROM [SHOW RANGES FROM TABLE hot_table] GROUP BY lease_holder;

-- Validate zone config
SHOW ZONE CONFIGURATION FOR TABLE hot_table;

-- Spread leaseholders if concentrated
ALTER TABLE hot_table CONFIGURE ZONE USING lease_preferences = '[[+region=us-west]]';
```

### Workflow 2: Zone Config Validation

**Scenario:** After configuring multi-region setup, validate ranges are placed according to constraints.

**Steps:**
1. **Review intended configs:** Run Query 5 (SHOW ZONE CONFIGURATIONS)
2. **Check actual replica placement:** Run Query 4 on critical tables, inspect `replicas` array for node IDs
3. **Map node IDs to regions:** Use `SHOW REGIONS` (cluster-wide) or read the `locality` column of `cockroach node status`
4. **Identify mismatches:** Ranges not matching constraints indicate rebalancing in progress or misconfiguration

**Example:**
```sql
-- Show zone config
SHOW ZONE CONFIGURATION FOR TABLE multi_region_table;

-- Check replica placement
SELECT range_id, replicas FROM [SHOW RANGES FROM TABLE multi_region_table] LIMIT 20;

-- Map node IDs to regions (cluster-level view)
SHOW REGIONS;
-- For per-node locality strings, use the CLI:
--   cockroach node status --certs-dir=<certs-dir> --host=<any-live-node>
```

### Workflow 3: Fragmentation Diagnosis

**Scenario:** Table with high range count relative to size, experiencing latency.

**Steps:**
1. **Calculate ranges per GB:** Run Query 6 (targeted to specific table)
2. **Check for load-based splits:** Review write patterns (sequential inserts, high QPS periods)
3. **Determine if expected:** Fragmentation may be intentional for load distribution
4. **Remediate if excessive:** Increase `range_max_bytes` (with caution - larger ranges = slower splits), or investigate reducing write hotspots

**CRITICAL:** `range_max_bytes` defaults to 512MB. Raising it further without understanding the impact on split/rebalance performance is risky.

## Safety Considerations

### DETAILS Option Cost

**Resource impact:**
- **CPU:** Computes span statistics on-demand for each range
- **Memory:** Proportional to range count returned
- **Timeout risk:** High on tables with 1000s of ranges without LIMIT

**Mitigation strategies:**
1. **Always use LIMIT:** Cap at 50-100 ranges for exploratory analysis
2. **Target specific tables:** Use `FROM TABLE table_name`, never cluster-wide `SHOW RANGES WITH DETAILS`
3. **Use basic queries first:** Run Query 1 (no DETAILS) to assess range count before using DETAILS
4. **Production timing:** Run during maintenance windows or low-traffic periods

### Privilege Safety

**Admin role:** Full cluster access, use with caution in production
**ZONECONFIG privilege:** Limited to viewing ranges and zone configs, safer for read-only analysis

**Best practice:** Grant `ZONECONFIG` instead of admin for range analysis operators.

See [permissions reference](references/permissions.md) for granting minimal privileges.

### Production Impact

**Read-only operations:** All queries are `SELECT` or `SHOW` statements with no writes.

**Performance considerations:**

| Query Type | Impact | Safe for Production? |
|------------|--------|---------------------|
| Basic SHOW RANGES | Minimal CPU, metadata-only | Yes |
| SHOW RANGES WITH DETAILS (targeted, LIMIT 50) | Moderate CPU spike | Yes (low-traffic window) |
| SHOW RANGES WITH DETAILS (no LIMIT) | High CPU, timeout risk | **NO - NEVER USE** |
| SHOW ZONE CONFIGURATIONS | Minimal, metadata-only | Yes |

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| Permission denied | Missing admin or ZONECONFIG privilege | Grant ZONECONFIG: `GRANT SYSTEM ZONECONFIG TO user` |
| Query timeout with DETAILS | Too many ranges without LIMIT | Add `LIMIT 50`, target specific table |
| Empty span_stats column | Missing DETAILS keyword | Add `WITH DETAILS` to SHOW RANGES |
| Unexpected high range count | Load-based splitting or fragmentation | Run Query 6 to calculate ranges/GB, review write patterns |
| Leaseholder = 0 or NULL | Range in transition during rebalancing | Normal during cluster changes, retry query |
| Under-replicated ranges | Node failure, decommission, zone mismatch | Check node status, validate zone config constraints |
| SHOW ZONE CONFIGURATIONS shows no custom configs | Using default cluster-wide config | Normal if no table/database-level overrides set |

## Key Considerations

- **DETAILS option:** Expensive operation - always use with LIMIT and targeted scope
- **Fragmentation is sometimes intentional:** Load-based splitting improves concurrency
- **Leaseholder concentration:** Check zone configs (lease_preferences) before assuming hotspot
- **Range size target:** Default `range_max_bytes` is 512MB (verify with `SHOW ZONE CONFIGURATION FOR RANGE default`)
- **Replication lag:** Range placement may not immediately reflect zone config changes (rebalancing takes time)
- **Cross-reference queries:** Combine range analysis with zone configs for complete picture
- **Node mapping:** Use `SHOW REGIONS` for cluster-level locality, or `cockroach node status` for per-node locality
