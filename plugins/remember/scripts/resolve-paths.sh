# resolve-paths.sh — Single source of truth for pipeline path resolution
# ============================================================================
#
# DESCRIPTION
#   Resolves PROJECT_DIR (the user's project root) and PIPELINE_DIR (the
#   plugin's install location) from environment variables set by Claude Code.
#   All pipeline scripts source this file instead of computing paths inline.
#
#   Supports three install layouts:
#     1. Local:       $PROJECT/.claude/remember/scripts/resolve-paths.sh
#     2. Marketplace: ~/.claude/plugins/cache/*/remember/*/scripts/resolve-paths.sh
#     3. Symlinked:   Any of the above with symlinks in the chain
#
# USAGE
#   source "$(dirname "$0")/resolve-paths.sh"
#   # Now PROJECT_DIR and PIPELINE_DIR are set and validated
#
# ENVIRONMENT (inputs)
#   CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR    Project root (set by Claude Code hooks)
#   CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT    Plugin install directory (set by Claude Code hooks)
#
# ENVIRONMENT (outputs)
#   PROJECT_DIR           Resolved project root (validated to exist)
#   PIPELINE_DIR          Resolved plugin root (validated to exist)
#
# EXIT CODES
#   1   Path resolution failed (PROJECT_DIR or PIPELINE_DIR not found)

# --- Restrict file creation permissions ---
# Prevent log files, memory files, and temp files from being world/group readable.
# On multi-user machines (shared dev box, CI runner, jumphost) the default umask
# (022) creates files as -rw-r--r--, leaking project paths, branch names, token
# counts, and memory contents to any local user.  Setting 077 here covers every
# downstream file created after this source: logs, .remember/ dirs, TMPDIR temps.

# --- Windows shell normalization (Git Bash / MSYS / Cygwin) ----------------
# Claude Code stores sessions under a Windows-native slug (e.g.
# "C--Users-dev-project") computed from the Win32 path "C:\Users\dev\project".
# But on Windows shells, $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR arrives as a POSIX-style path
# ("/c/Users/dev/project") and our sed-based slug produces "-c-Users-dev-..."
# which never matches. The plugin's `ls $SESSION_DIR/*.jsonl` then returns
# nothing and the entire save pipeline silently no-ops.
#
# Convert /c/Users/... → C:\Users\... here so all downstream slug computations
# (3 shell sites + Python `_session_dir`) align with Claude Code's storage.
# On Linux/macOS bash $OSTYPE is "linux-gnu" or "darwin*"; the case below
# never matches and PROJECT_DIR is left untouched.
