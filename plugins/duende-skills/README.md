## Installation

You can use several AI coding assistants that support skills/agents.

### Claude Code (CLI)

[Official Docs](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/discover-plugins)

Run these commands inside the Claude Code CLI:

mkdir -p ~/.config/opencode/skills ~/.config/opencode/agents
for skill_file in /tmp/duende-skills/skills/*/SKILL.md; do
  skill_dir=$(dirname "$skill_file")
  skill_name=$(grep -m1 "^name:" "$skill_file" | sed 's/name: *//')
  mkdir -p ~/.config/opencode/skills/$skill_name
  cp "$skill_file" ~/.config/opencode/skills/$skill_name/SKILL.md
  # Copy bundled resources (docs/, references/, etc.) if present
  find "$skill_dir" -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 1 -type d -exec cp -r {} ~/.config/opencode/skills/$skill_name/ \;
done
cp /tmp/duende-skills/agents/*.md ~/.config/opencode/agents/

## Skill Evaluation Benchmarks

Each skill is evaluated using 5–12 realistic prompts with concrete assertions. Every prompt is answered **with the skill loaded** and **without it** (baseline), then graded against the assertions. This measures the incremental value each skill provides over general LLM knowledge.

Run evals for all skills using GitHub Models (via `gh` CLI):

```bash
./scripts/run-evals.sh --iteration 4 --verbose
```

### Results — June 16, 2026 (claude-opus-4-20250514, iteration 3)

**Key findings:**
- **Highest-value skills** (>50% delta): User Management (+100%), SAML (+88.6%), Upgrade v7→v8 (+82.8%), DCR (+76.9%), Sessions (+67.6%), BFF (+65.1%), Token Management (+61.4%), Token Security (+61.1%), Aspire (+59.4%), Deployment (+55.9%), API Protection (+53.3%), Key Management (+50.0%) — deeply Duende-specific knowledge where baseline LLM knowledge falls short.
- **Moderate-value skills** (25–50% delta): Claims authorization, IS4 migration, UI flows, configuration, token lifecycle, hosting setup, authentication, testing patterns, stores — specialized patterns that improve precision significantly.
- **Lower-delta skills** (<25%): Security hardening, OAuth/OIDC protocols, authorization — well-known patterns where baseline model knowledge is already strong, but skills still close remaining gaps.
- **Notable changes vs. previous iteration**: Upgrade v7→v8 skill improved from +51.7% to +82.8% delta (expanded SKILL.md with 6 new breaking changes and NuGet version guidance). Key Management jumped from +6.0% to +50.0% (stricter grading). Sessions Providers jumped from +35.1% to +67.6%.

## Key Principles

- **Security by Default** — PKCE enforced, no implicit flow, short-lived access tokens, refresh token rotation
- **Protocol Compliance** — OAuth 2.0 Security BCP, OpenID Connect Core, RFC-grounded guidance
- **Type Safety** — Strongly-typed IDs for clients, resources, scopes; nullable reference types throughout
- **Testable Architecture** — DI everywhere, WebApplicationFactory for integration tests, no static state
- **Production Patterns** — Key rotation, data protection, health checks, structured logging

- `identity-*` for cross-cutting identity concerns
- `oauth-*` / `token-*` / `claims-*` for protocol and authz skills

**General .NET skills** (C#, EF Core, Aspire, DI, etc.) belong in [dotnet-skills](https://github.com/Aaronontheweb/dotnet-skills), not here. This repo focuses exclusively on identity, authentication, and authorization.

See `CLAUDE.md` for the full contribution workflow.

## Disclaimer

Duende's AI developer tools (including the Duende Documentation MCP Server and Duende Agent Skills) are designed
to provide Large Language Models (LLMs) with verified, structured context from Duende's documentation and product knowledge.
These tools improve the quality and relevance of AI-assisted development with Duende products, including IdentityServer,
BFF and our Open Source offerings, but they do not guarantee the correctness, security, or completeness
of AI-generated output. All code, configuration, and architectural decisions produced with the assistance of these tools
must be reviewed and validated by qualified developers before deployment to any environment.
Duende Software is not responsible for AI-generated output that results from the use of these tools.

Duende Agent Skills provide structured task capabilities to LLM agents for common development workflows.
Skills are designed to reduce implementation errors, but they operate within the LLM's reasoning process and are subject
to the LLM's limitations. Skill outputs (including generated code, configuration, and recommendations) should be treated
as developer assistance, not as production-ready artifacts. Test all skill outputs thoroughly in your own environment
before deploying to staging or production.
