## Features

### Vanta MCP Server

Claude Code automatically connects to Vanta's hosted MCP server for your region:

```bash
# US
https://mcp.vanta.com/mcp

# EU
https://mcp.eu.vanta.com/mcp

# Aus
https://mcp.aus.vanta.com/mcp
```

This gives Claude tools to:

- **Remediate failing tests** — list failing compliance tests, inspect which entities are out of scope, and get the context needed to fix them
- **Manage controls** — browse controls and their framework mappings, list associated tests, and access linked evidence documents
- **Assess vendor risk** — review vendors, run security assessments, manage risk attributes, and track compliance documentation
- **Track vulnerabilities** — surface vulnerable assets, and monitor remediation progress
- **Govern policies** — list, download, and upload policy documents across your compliance program
- **Analyze compliance gaps** — enumerate framework requirements and identify coverage gaps across SOC 2, ISO 27001, and more
