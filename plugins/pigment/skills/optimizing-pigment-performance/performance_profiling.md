# Performance Profiling (Modeler Agent)

Measure compute performance with profiling tools, parse their output, and report findings to the user. For scope mechanics and formula fixes, see [./performance_scoping_patterns.md](./performance_scoping_patterns.md). For the full performance loop, see [./performance_troubleshooting_workflow.md](./performance_troubleshooting_workflow.md).

## Prerequisites

| Tool | Use when |
|---|---|
| `tool:get_top_blocks_by_performance` | Hotspot block unknown; rank blocks app-wide over a time window |
| `tool:performance_profile_change` | Slow action reproduced; you have `change_id` from audit trail |

## Workflow

1. **Triage (optional).** `tool:get_top_blocks_by_performance` with `scenario_id`, `range_start`, `range_end`, `top_n`, and `criteria`: `ExecutionTimeSumMs` (total cost), `ExecutionTimeAvgMs` (typical cost), `ExecutionCount` (churn), `CombinedCardinality` (data volume, no execution history needed).
2. **Reproduce** the slow input or formula change.
3. **Profile.** `tool:performance_profile_change` with `change_id` (UUID).
4. **Analyze** using sections below; map `Blocks:` to formulas.
5. **Fix one change at a time.** New `change_id` → re-profile → compare `Duration` and scope.

**Board-render fork:** Low total execution time but slow board load → `skill:designing-boards`, not formula work.

## Top blocks output

```
Top N blocks ranked by performance:
- {block_id} ({block_type}) — cardinality={n}, executions={count}, avg_ms={avg}, sum_ms={sum}
```

Missing `job_profile` → widen the time window or switch `criteria`. Then profile a change on the suspect block.

---

## Change profile output

```
Change profiled successfully. N execution(s) found.

Executions:
1. **{job_type}**
   - Id: {uuid}
   - Blocks: Metric(`uuid`), ...
   - Dimensions: uuid1, uuid2, ...
   - Ready at: Xms, Executed at: Yms, Duration: Zms
   - Effective scope: {text}
   - Output scope: {text}
   - Depends on: uuid, ...   ← optional
```

| Field | Meaning | Tell the user |
|---|---|---|
| Ready at | Wait for dependencies | Ready at |
| Executed at | Ready + queue contention | Executed at |
| Duration | Compute time | Duration |
| Effective scope | Scope used | Effective scope |
| Output scope | Scope passed downstream | Output scope |
| Depends on | Upstream execution IDs | Dependencies |

**Block labels:** `Metric(...)`, `List(...)`, `Table(...)`, `Cycle(...)`, `Block(app:...)`.

**Scope text:**

| Text | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `no change` | No cells written |
| `no scope, full computation` | Full recompute (X = 0) |
| `dim:uuid (N modalities), ...` | Scoped to N modalities per dimension |

### X/Y notation

- **Y** = count on `Dimensions:` line
- **X** = count of `dim:` entries in `Effective scope:`
- Target **X = Y** on hot paths

| Effective | Output | Interpretation |
|---|---|---|
| `dim:...` | Same | Scope preserved |
| `dim:...` | More dims | Scope introduced downstream |
| any | `no change` | Ran, no output (still check Duration) |
| `no scope, full computation` | — | Scope-loss origin candidate |

First `no scope, full computation` → inspect that block's formula (`REMOVE`, `CUMULATE`, `PREVIOUS`, `RANK`).

### Time and dependencies

- Sort by **Duration**; flag > 1000 ms or dominant wall-time share.
- **Contention** = Executed at − Ready at (large vs Duration → workload/queueing, not formula).
- **Wall time** ≈ max(Executed at + Duration) across executions.
- Match `Depends on` UUIDs to upstream `Id:` lines; ancestors appear earlier in the list.

### Patterns

| Pattern | Signature | Action |
|---|---|---|
| Cascading scope loss | Scoped runs, then first `no scope, full computation`, rest full/no change | Defer `REMOVE`/aggregations; see scoping patterns doc |
| No change, high Duration | `Output scope: no change` and Duration > 500 ms | Add earlier `FILTER`/`EXCLUDE` |
| High contention | Executed at ≫ Ready at on many rows | Broad scope or too many parallel branches |

---

## Report to the user

Include: execution count, approximate wall time, permission filter note, chain with natural block names, X/Y per step, slowest step, scope-loss origin, one recommendation.

**Vocabulary:** Say ready at, executed at, duration, scope, dependency. Do not say execution_id, time_schedule_ms, effective_scope, clauses.
