## Quick Reference

| Function              | Purpose                        | Syntax Example                            |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| **ACCESSRIGHTS**      | Define read/write access       | `ACCESSRIGHTS(ReadBoolean, WriteBoolean)` |
| **RESETACCESSRIGHTS** | Remove inherited access rights | `RESETACCESSRIGHTS(Expression)`           |

## ACCESSRIGHTS

Constructs an Access Rights value based on specified read and write Boolean conditions. Used within Access Rights Metrics to define which users can read or write data.

**Syntax**: `ACCESSRIGHTS(ReadAccessBoolean, WriteAccessBoolean)`

**Parameters**:

- **ReadAccessBoolean**: Boolean. TRUE allows Members to read data, FALSE or BLANK prevents reading
- **WriteAccessBoolean**: Boolean. TRUE allows Members to write data, FALSE or BLANK prevents writing

**Return Type**: Access Rights

**Examples**:

```pigment
ACCESSRIGHTS(TRUE, FALSE) // Grants read-only access
ACCESSRIGHTS(User.Role = "Admin", TRUE) // Grants read access to Admins, write access to all
```

**Key Points**:

- Use BLANK instead of FALSE for better performance with Pigment's sparse engine
- Does not directly apply access rights to a Block; builds Access Rights values for use in Access Rights Metrics
- For performance: `IFDEFINED(User, 'Revenue'[AR: 'Rules'])` (see [formula_performance_patterns.md](./formula_performance_patterns.md))

## RESETACCESSRIGHTS

Removes **inherited** access rights from the referenced Block or expression. Direct access rights rules applied to the Block itself will still apply.

**Syntax**: `RESETACCESSRIGHTS(Expression)`

**Parameters**:

- **Expression**: The formula or Block reference from which to remove inherited access rights

**Return Type**: Same as Expression

**Examples**:

```pigment
// Remove inherited access rights from 'Metric A' only
RESETACCESSRIGHTS('Metric A') + 'Metric B'
```

**Use Cases**:

- **Aggregations**: Allow users with partial access to see totals or calculated results
- **Shared Blocks**: Control access rights inheritance when referencing Blocks shared from other Applications
- **Performance Optimization**: Reduce redundant access rights inheritance in complex models

**Key Points**:

- Only removes _inherited_ access rights (direct access rights rules still apply)
- Use as specifically as possible to avoid exposing more data than intended
- Application settings may need adjustment for shared Blocks

## Best Practices

1. **Apply Access Rights at the Right Level**: Apply as late as possible in calculation chains
2. **Document Security Logic**: Clearly document where and why access rights are applied or reset
3. **Test Security**: Verify access rights work correctly for different user roles
4. **Minimize RESETACCESSRIGHTS**: Only use when calculations truly require the full dataset

---

## Critical Rules

- **Use BLANK over FALSE** - Better performance with sparse engine
- **ACCESSRIGHTS builds values** - Used in Access Rights Metrics, not directly applied
- **RESETACCESSRIGHTS removes inherited only** - Direct rules still apply
- **Performance pattern**: `IFDEFINED(User, Data[AR: 'Rules'])` (see performance patterns)
- **Test thoroughly** - Verify for different user roles
