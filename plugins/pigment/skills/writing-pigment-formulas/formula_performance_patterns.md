# Formula Performance Patterns

**Apply this checklist proportionally to formula complexity.** Simple arithmetic between existing same-dimensioned metrics (e.g. `'A' + 'B'`, `'A' * 'B'`, `'A' / 'B'`) needs no performance wrapping — deliver as-is. Review these patterns for formulas that involve conditionals, dimensional changes, date-range logic, or that target large/sparse metrics.

This checklist ensures formulas are performant. For detailed explanations, see the `skill:optimizing-pigment-performance`.

## Performance Checklist

Before delivering a formula, verify the applicable items:

**Always check (universal):**

- [ ] Identifiers are correctly quoted (single quotes for names, double quotes for items)
- [ ] Dimensions are aligned — no unintended ADD or dimension mismatch
- [ ] Scoping clauses appear FIRST (FILTER, EXCLUDE, IFDEFINED)
- [ ] Aggregations appear AFTER calculations

**Check when conditionals are present:**

- [ ] Avoid ISBLANK on large sparse metrics — use IFDEFINED or ISDEFINED
- [ ] Use IFBLANK for defaults, not IF(ISBLANK(...))
- [ ] Conditional creation: use IF (not ADD + FILTER); subsetting a computed expression: use FILTER: CurrentValue (not IF(expr, expr, BLANK))

**Check when date ranges are defined by Start/End:**

- [ ] Avoid multi-conditional IFs (`Date >= Start AND Date < End`) when PRORATA semantics apply
- [ ] Prefer `PRORATA()` for "active within a date range" and derive booleans/numeric flags from `PRORATA()` (use ISDEFINED/IFDEFINED, not ISBLANK/ISNOTBLANK)

**Check when prior period lookups are needed:**

- [ ] Using SELECT for prior period lookups, NOT PREVIOUS

**Check when dimensional changes or mappings are involved:**

- [ ] Using BY instead of ADD where mapping exists
- [ ] Do not use ISBLANK/ISNOTBLANK to guard BY when a dimension-typed metric is in BY; BY respects that metric's sparsity (see [formula_modifiers.md](./formula_modifiers.md))

**Check when the metric is large/sparse or involves access rights:**

- [ ] Use BLANK instead of 0 or FALSE for empty values (see Pattern 9 exception for meaningful zeros)
- [ ] Access rights wrapped in IFDEFINED(User, ...)

## Core Principles

1. **Scope First**: Start formulas with scoping clauses
2. **Preserve Sparsity**: Use ISDEFINED, not ISBLANK
3. **Reduce Early**: Aggregate/filter before complex calculations
4. **Understand Execution Order**: Structure for minimal computation

## Understanding Sparsity and Densification

### Key Terminology

**BLANK, undefined, and "not defined" are ALL THE SAME THING** - they mean no value exists in a cell.

| Term        | Meaning                | Stored in Database? |
| ----------- | ---------------------- | ------------------- |
| BLANK       | No value exists        | **No** (sparse)     |
| undefined   | No value exists        | **No** (sparse)     |
| not defined | No value exists        | **No** (sparse)     |
| FALSE       | Explicit boolean value | **Yes** (dense)     |
| TRUE        | Explicit boolean value | **Yes** (dense)     |
| 0           | Explicit numeric value | **Yes** (dense)     |

### What is Densification?

**Densification** occurs when cells that should have no value (BLANK/undefined) are given explicit values (TRUE, FALSE, 0, etc.). This forces Pigment to store and compute ALL cells instead of just the ones with actual data.

**Example**: A metric with 1,000 products × 12 months = 12,000 possible cells. If only 500 have actual values:

- **Sparse**: 500 cells stored (4% of space) — empty cells remain undefined
- **Dense**: 12,000 cells stored (100% of space, 24x larger) — if we store 0 for empty cells, all 12,000 must be stored

### Why ISBLANK Densifies

`ISBLANK` returns explicit boolean values for ALL cells:

- Where value exists: returns **FALSE** (stored)
- Where value is blank: returns **TRUE** (stored)

Both TRUE and FALSE are stored → **all cells now have values → dense**.

### Why ISDEFINED Preserves Sparsity

`ISDEFINED` returns:

- Where value exists: returns **TRUE** (stored)
- Where value is blank: returns **BLANK** (not stored)

Only TRUE values are stored → **blank cells remain blank → sparse**.

---

## Performance Patterns

### Pattern 1: Early Scoping

**Why**: Scoping at the end forces Pigment to compute ALL data first, then filter. Scoping at the start limits computation to only relevant data.

**Anti-pattern** (computes everything, then filters):

```pigment
('Revenue' * 'Growth' + 'Costs')[FILTER: 'Product'.'Active' = TRUE]
```

**Optimized** (filters first, computes only active products):

```pigment
'Revenue'[FILTER: 'Product'.'Active' = TRUE] * 'Growth' + 'Costs'
```

---

### Pattern 2: Sparsity Preservation with IFDEFINED

**Why**: ISBLANK returns explicit boolean values (TRUE/FALSE) for ALL cells, causing densification. IFDEFINED returns BLANK for undefined cells, preserving sparsity.

**Less idiomatic on large sparse metrics** (densifies — ISBLANK returns TRUE for blank cells, FALSE for defined cells):

```pigment
IF(ISBLANK('Revenue'), 0, 'Revenue' * 1.1)
```

**What happens**: Every cell gets a value (TRUE, FALSE, 0, or calculated result) → dense.

**Optimized** (preserves sparsity — returns BLANK for undefined cells):

```pigment
IFDEFINED('Revenue', 'Revenue' * 1.1)
```

**What happens**: Only cells where Revenue is defined get calculated; others remain BLANK → sparse.

**Context guard**: On small already-dense metrics or where explicit TRUE/FALSE output is required (e.g. data-completeness exports), `IF(ISBLANK(...))` is acceptable; see [functions_logical.md](./functions_logical.md) allow-list.

---

### Pattern 3: Use IFBLANK for Default Values

**Why**: IFBLANK is simpler, clearer, and optimized for the common pattern of providing a default when a value is blank.

**Less idiomatic** (verbose and densifies on large sparse metrics):

```pigment
IF(ISBLANK('Revenue'), 'Default Revenue', 'Revenue')
```

**Optimized** (cleaner and faster):

```pigment
IFBLANK('Revenue', 'Default Revenue')
```

**Context guard**: On small already-dense metrics, `IF(ISBLANK(...))` is functionally equivalent and acceptable if readability is the priority; see [functions_logical.md](./functions_logical.md) allow-list.

---

### Pattern 4: IF vs FILTER — Two Distinct Cases

The rule "use IF, not ADD + FILTER" applies only to **conditional creation**. When **subsetting an expression you are already computing**, prefer **FILTER: CurrentValue** over IF. Do not interpret "use IF" as "IF is always better than FILTER."

#### Case A: Conditional creation (no existing expression / using ADD)

**Why**: ADD creates all possible cells then filters (dense). IF creates only cells where the condition is true (sparse).

**Anti-pattern** (dense - creates all Month cells, then filters):

```pigment
10[ADD: Month][FILTER: Month > VAR_Reference_Month]
```

**Optimized** (sparse - only creates cells where condition is true):

```pigment
// VAR_Reference_Month: input metric, type Dimension
IF(Month > VAR_Reference_Month, 10)
```

#### Case B: Subsetting an expression you're already computing (no ADD)

**Why**: When IF repeats the same expensive expression in the condition and result, it will be evaluated twice. [FILTER: CurrentValue] computes it only once, then filters on the result — usually faster and clearer for large or complex calculations.

For simple metric references or arithmetic on small spaces, IF is equally performant and often more readable.

**Less idiomatic on large spaces with expensive expressions** (repeats expression):

```pigment
IF(
  MONTHDIF(Month.'Start Date', Employee.'Hire Date'[ADD: Month]) >= 0,
  MONTHDIF(Month.'Start Date', Employee.'Hire Date'[ADD: Month]) + 1,
  BLANK
)
```

**Optimized** (single evaluation, filter on result):

```pigment
(
  MONTHDIF(Month.'Start Date', Employee.'Hire Date'[ADD: Month]) + 1
)[FILTER: CurrentValue > 0]
```

**When to use each**:

- **IF**: Conditional creation — adding values to new cells (no ADD in the alternative). Prefer IF over `value[ADD: Dim][FILTER: condition]`. Also acceptable for simple expressions on small spaces where readability matters.
- **FILTER: CurrentValue**: Subsetting a computed expression — you have one expression and want to keep only cells where its value meets a condition. Prefer `(Expression)[FILTER: CurrentValue > threshold]` over `IF(Expression > threshold, Expression, BLANK)`, especially when Expression is non-trivial and the metric space is large.

---

### Pattern 5: Defer Aggregations

**Why**: Aggregating early reduces data then multiplies, which can lose precision or produce wrong results. Aggregating late ensures calculations happen at full granularity.

**Anti-pattern** (aggregates first, then multiplies - wrong if Growth varies by Product):

```pigment
'Revenue'[REMOVE: Product] * 'Growth'
```

**Optimized** (calculates at Product level, then aggregates):

```pigment
('Revenue' * 'Growth')[REMOVE: Product]
```

---

### Pattern 6: Prefer BY over ADD

**Why**: BY uses a mapping and is sparse (only computes for existing data). ADD creates all possible combinations and is dense. Always prefer BY when a mapping property exists.

**Anti-pattern** (dense allocation to all combinations then filter, instead of targeted allocation):

```pigment
'MyMetric'[ADD: Version][FILTER: Version = MyVersion]
```

**Optimized** (sparse allocation via mapping):

```pigment
'MyMetric'[BY: MyVersion]
```

**Note**: BY requires a mapping property or a dimension formatted metric. If no mapping exists and you must use ADD, consider if the formula design can be changed.

---

### Pattern 7: SELECT for Prior Period Lookups (NOT PREVIOUS)

**Why**: SELECT is parallel (fast). PREVIOUS/PREVIOUSOF are sequential iterative functions (slow). Use SELECT for all simple lookups.

**Anti-pattern** — PREVIOUS/PREVIOUSOF for simple lookups (reserve them for true iterative calculations only):

```pigment
// 'Forecast Sales' metric
PREVIOUSOF('Actual Sales')
```

**Optimized** (fast - parallel computation, not on the same metric):

```pigment
// 'Forecast Sales' metric
'Actual Sales'[SELECT: Month-1] * (1 + 'Growth rate')
```

**When PREVIOUS/PREVIOUSOF is OK**: Only when current period's calculated result depends on prior period's calculated result (e.g., running balances: `PREVIOUSOF('Balance') + 'Inflow' - 'Outflow'`). See [functions_iterative_calculation.md](./functions_iterative_calculation.md) for full guidance.

---

### Pattern 8: Access Rights with IFDEFINED(User)

**Why**: Without IFDEFINED(User), access rights are computed for ALL users in the system. Wrapping in IFDEFINED(User) ensures computation only happens for the current user.

**Anti-pattern** (computes for all users):

```pigment
'Revenue'[AR: 'Rules']
```

**Optimized** (computes only for current user):

```pigment
IFDEFINED(User, 'Revenue'[AR: 'Rules'])
```

---

### Pattern 9: Use BLANK Instead of 0 (When Zero Has No Meaning)

**Why**: Using 0 creates dense data with explicit zeros stored. BLANK preserves sparsity — empty cells take no storage or computation.

**Less idiomatic on large sparse metrics** (creates explicit zeros — dense):

```pigment
IF(condition, value, 0)
```

**Optimized** (preserves sparsity):

```pigment
IF(condition, value, BLANK)
```

**Or simply omit the else clause** (defaults to BLANK):

```pigment
IF(condition, value)
```

**Exception — when 0 is a meaningful business value:**

Use 0 (not BLANK) when zero is a meaningful result that the user expects to see, or when 0 participates in downstream multiplication / summation where the additive identity matters. Examples:

- Zero variance (budget equals actual)
- Zero balance (account fully settled)
- Zero growth rate (flat period)
- A line item is inactive but the total row must show 0, not BLANK

```pigment
// Budget vs actual variance: show 0 when they match, not BLANK
IF('Actual' > 'Budget', 'Actual' - 'Budget', 0)
```

**Rule of thumb**: BLANK means "not applicable / no data at this coordinate." Zero means "the value is zero." Choose based on semantic intent.

---

### Pattern 10: Use BLANK Instead of FALSE for Boolean Flags

**Why**: FALSE is an explicit boolean value that gets stored. BLANK means "not defined" and is not stored. For sparse boolean metrics, use BLANK where the condition is not met.

**Anti-pattern** (stores FALSE for every non-matching cell - dense):

```pigment
// Creates TRUE/FALSE for ALL cells
ISNOTBLANK('Revenue')

// Or explicitly returning FALSE
IF('Revenue' > 1000, TRUE, FALSE)
```

**Optimized** (only stores TRUE where condition is met - sparse):

```pigment
// Returns TRUE where defined, BLANK (not FALSE) elsewhere
ISDEFINED('Revenue')

// Or returning BLANK instead of FALSE
IF('Revenue' > 1000, TRUE, BLANK)
// Or simply:
IF('Revenue' > 1000, TRUE)
```

**Key insight**: `BLANK ≠ FALSE`. BLANK means "no value" (not stored). FALSE means "explicit boolean false" (stored). Use BLANK for sparsity.

---

### Pattern 11: Date Range Presence (Prefer PRORATA over multi-conditional IF)

**Why**: Single source of truth for date-range presence, less verbose, correct boundaries (Start included, End+1 for inclusive), sparsity preserved when deriving via ISDEFINED/IFDEFINED.

**Less idiomatic on Day-level dimensions or when boundary handling and reuse matter** (multi-conditional IF for presence — verbose, error-prone at boundaries):

```pigment
IF(
  Day >= 'Start Date'
  AND Day <= 'End Date',
  1,
  BLANK
)
```

**Optimized** (encode once with PRORATA, derive flags with ISDEFINED/IFDEFINED):

```pigment
// Numeric presence on Day (1 on active days, BLANK outside range)
PRORATA(Day, 'Start Date', 'End Date' + 1)

// Numeric presence on Month (proportional factor per month)
PRORATA(Month, 'Start Date', 'End Date' + 1)

// Boolean presence: TRUE when active, BLANK otherwise
ISDEFINED(PRORATA(Day, 'Start Date', 'End Date' + 1))

// Numeric 1/BLANK flag
IFDEFINED(PRORATA(Day, 'Start Date', 'End Date' + 1), 1)
```

Do not use ISBLANK/ISNOTBLANK for this pattern — they densify. Use ISDEFINED or IFDEFINED on the PRORATA result.

**When simple IF is acceptable**: On small planning horizons with Month-level presence flags or for one-off single-date cutover comparisons, `IF(Month >= 'Start Month' AND Month <= 'End Month', TRUE)` is acceptable and clearer. Prefer PRORATA when proration semantics, boundary correctness, or cross-metric reuse matter.

| Presence in date range           | PRORATA + ISDEFINED/IFDEFINED  | Multi-conditional IF, ISBLANK/ISNOTBLANK  |

**Remember**: BLANK = undefined = not defined (all mean "no value", not stored). FALSE ≠ BLANK (FALSE is an explicit value that IS stored).
