# Formula Conditionals Style

**When to use this doc**: Conditional logic with IF/SWITCH or modifiers (FILTER, EXCLUDE), or highly complex formulas that require performance optimization.

**Goal**: Readable Pigment-native formulas. Use IF to scope early; IFBLANK for overrides/precedence; `[FILTER: ...]` to subset an existing metric when that reads most naturally. Avoid ISBLANK/ISNOTBLANK and unnecessary densification.

**Related**: Syntax and function reference → [functions_logical.md](./functions_logical.md), [formula_modifiers.md](./formula_modifiers.md). Performance (scoping, densification) → [formula_performance_patterns.md](./formula_performance_patterns.md).

## Quick Reference: When to Use What

**Note**: IFBLANK is the right tool for sparsity-driven branching (presence checks, override hierarchies). For value-based branching where both branches return non-blank values, IF and SWITCH are equally idiomatic and often more readable.

| Situation | Prefer | Avoid |
| --------- | ------ | ----- |
| Choose between two scalar values based on a comparison or classification (value-based branching) | `IF(condition, A, B)` or `SWITCH(...)` | Wrapping in IFBLANK when both values are always defined |
| "First non-blank wins" (override hierarchy) | `IFBLANK(Expr1, IFBLANK(Expr2, ...))` | Nested `IF(cond1, Expr1, IF(cond2, Expr2, ...))` |
| Override when present, else base | `IFBLANK('Override', 'Base')` | `IF(ISBLANK('Override'), 'Base', 'Override')` |
| Branch on "is this input defined?" | `IFDEFINED('Input', 'Input', 'Fallback')` or `IFBLANK(ISDEFINED('Input'), 'Fallback'[EXCLUDE: ...])` (advanced) | Nested IF with AND/OR on flags |
| Subset an existing metric by row | `'Metric'[FILTER: ...]` or `[EXCLUDE: ...]` | Repeating the metric in both IF branches |
| Exclude a flagged subset | `'Metric'[EXCLUDE: 'Entity'.'Is_Archived']` | `'Metric'[FILTER: NOT 'Entity'.'Is_Archived']` |
| Sparse boolean "tag where condition holds" | `IF(condition, TRUE)` or `IF(condition, TRUE, BLANK)` | `condition` alone (densifies to TRUE/FALSE) |
| Both IF branches share same expression (e.g. same metric + modifiers) | Factor out: `Expr * IF(cond, a, b)` or `Expr + IF(cond, x, y)` | Repeating `Expr` in both branches |
| Multiple branches repeat same FILTER/EXCLUDE conditions (3+ similar blocks) | Nested IF that factors common expression; vary only the differing part (see section 2.5) | IFBLANK with repeated FILTER/EXCLUDE on each branch (can degrade performance) |

## 1. IFBLANK for presence-driven branching

IFBLANK is for **presence-driven branching**:

- Precedence / case chains ("first non-blank wins")
- Override vs default logic

For **value-based branching** (comparison-driven classification, threshold assignment), prefer IF or SWITCH — they are the natural tool when both branches always produce a value.

### 1.1 Precedence chains ("first non-blank wins")

**Goal**: Choose the first expression that returns a value; if blank, try the next.

**Canonical pattern**:

```pigment
// First non-blank among Expr1, Expr2, Expr3, Expr4
IFBLANK(
  Expr1,
  IFBLANK(
    Expr2,
    IFBLANK(
      Expr3,
      Expr4
    )
  )
)
```

- If Expr1 has a value → use it; else Expr2; else Expr3; else Expr4.
- Use for: override hierarchy, multi-source chaining (e.g. plan → actual → baseline → constant).
- If any expression is complex, move it into a helper metric and reference it in the chain.

### 1.2 Override vs base (no explicit ISDEFINED)

**Goal**: Use an override when present; otherwise use a base value.

**Canonical pattern**:

```pigment
IFBLANK('Override_Metric', 'Base_Metric')
```

**Avoid**:

```pigment
IF(ISBLANK('Override_Metric'), 'Base_Metric', 'Override_Metric')
```

### 1.3 Sparsity-driven branching on definedness

**Goal**: When the driver for branching is "does this input exist?", not its value.

**Default pattern** (when you need "use override if present, else fallback"):

```pigment
IFDEFINED('Input', 'Input', 'Fallback')
```

Or equivalently:

```pigment
IFBLANK('Input', 'Fallback')
```

**Advanced pattern** (when you need a TRUE-or-BLANK signal as the branch trigger, e.g. to scope the fallback with EXCLUDE):

```pigment
IFBLANK(
  ISDEFINED('Context_Specific_Input'),
  'Fallback_Expression'[EXCLUDE: 'Entity'.'Excluded_Flag'] < 'Context'.'Cutoff'
)
```

- First argument: test signal (TRUE where context input exists, BLANK where it doesn't).
- Second argument: fallback expression when there is no context-specific input.
- Use EXCLUDE (or FILTER) to scope the fallback by row, not AND/OR inside the expression.

Use the advanced form only when you need EXCLUDE/FILTER scoping on the fallback branch. For most override-vs-fallback formulas, `IFBLANK('Override', 'Fallback')` or `IFDEFINED('Input', 'Input', 'Fallback')` are clearer.

### 1.4 When to refactor a nested IF chain into IFBLANK

**Nested IF is the natural form for**:

- Value-based threshold classification (e.g. risk tiers, margin buckets, score bands)
- Exact-match multi-way branching (prefer SWITCH for this)
- Cases where both branches always produce a defined value

**Refactor to IFBLANK when** the branching driver is data presence (one or more branches may be BLANK).

**Less idiomatic for presence-driven logic**:

```pigment
IF(cond1, Expr1, IF(cond2, Expr2, IF(cond3, Expr3, Expr4)))
```

**Prefer** one of (when presence is the driver):

- Precedence chain: `IFBLANK(Expr1, IFBLANK(Expr2, IFBLANK(Expr3, Expr4)))` (when "first defined wins").
- Override vs base: `IFBLANK('Override', 'Base')`.
- Signal-based: `IFBLANK(ISDEFINED('Input'), 'Fallback'[EXCLUDE: ...])` (advanced).

For 3+ branches with the same FILTER/EXCLUDE stack repeating, see section 2.5 — nested IF with factored conditions is often faster.

## 2. FILTER and EXCLUDE: When and How

FILTER and EXCLUDE control **which dimensional combinations exist** in an expression. Use them when the question is "which rows/coordinates should this apply to?", not "which of two scalar expressions do I pick?".

### 2.1 Use separate FILTERs (and EXCLUDEs)

**Canonical**:

```pigment
'Metric'
[FILTER: 'Entity'.'Status' = "Active"]
[FILTER: 'Entity'.'Region' = "EMEA"]
```

**Less preferred** (one big AND):

```pigment
'Metric'[FILTER: 'Entity'.'Status' = "Active" AND 'Entity'.'Region' = "EMEA"]
```

Separate modifiers are easier to read, debug, and mix with EXCLUDE.

### 2.2 Filter by expression value: use CURRENTVALUE

**Canonical**:

```pigment
'Revenue'[FILTER: CURRENTVALUE > 0]
'Margin %'[FILTER: CURRENTVALUE >= 0.20][FILTER: 'Entity'.'Status' = "Live"]
```

This avoids repeating the expression and keeps value rules and property rules separate.

### 2.3 Exclude a flagged subset: use EXCLUDE, not FILTER NOT

**Canonical**:

```pigment
'Metric'[EXCLUDE: 'Entity'.'Is_Discontinued']
'Metric'[EXCLUDE: 'Entity'.'Is_Archived'][EXCLUDE: 'Entity'.'Is_Test_Data']
```

**Avoid**:

```pigment
'Metric'[FILTER: NOT 'Entity'.'Is_Archived']
```

EXCLUDE keeps semantics positive ("drop these rows") and preserves sparsity; NOT over a boolean that can be BLANK densifies. See section 3.

### 2.4 Factorize common subexpressions in IF branches

When **both branches** of an IF use the **same expression** (e.g. the same metric with the same FILTER/EXCLUDE), prefer **factoring it out** so the IF only chooses the differing part (multiplier, constant, etc.). This keeps expressions small and composable (DRY).

**Less idiomatic** (repeated EXCLUDE and base expression in both branches):

```pigment
IF(
  IsForecast
    AND ( ... segment test ... ),
  'Revenue'[EXCLUDE: Customers.'Exclude from ARR Report'],
  'Revenue'[EXCLUDE: Customers.'Exclude from ARR Report']
)
```

**More idiomatic** (one EXCLUDE, IF only on the multiplier):

```pigment
'Revenue'[EXCLUDE: Customers.'Exclude from ARR Report']
* IF(
    IsForecast
      AND ( ... segment test ... ),
    1.10,
    1
  )
```

Apply the same idea when the only difference between branches is an additive constant, a divisor, or another scalar: factor the common expression once and use IF for the varying part.

### 2.5 When nested IF is acceptable (repeated FILTER/EXCLUDE)

When **multiple branches** (e.g. 3+) use the **same FILTER/EXCLUDE conditions** with only a varying expression or multiplier, the IFBLANK/FILTER pattern can degrade performance. Each branch evaluates its own scoped expression; repeated modifiers across many branches add overhead.

**Prefer** a nested IF that factors out the common logic and uses IF only for the varying part:

```pigment
// Multiple branches with same conditions
// Prefer: factor common conditions, vary only the differing expression
IF(
  'Headcount ID'.Approved? AND (
    'WFP_Elect to Backfill?' = FALSE
    OR ISBLANK('WFP_Elect to Backfill?')
    OR ('WFP_Elect to Backfill?' AND Month < TIMEDIM('WFP_Backfill Date', Month))
  ),
  'WFP_Salary'
  * IF(Month >= 'WFP_Merit Effective', 1, 1 - 'Global Merit Adjustment'[BY: 'Headcount ID'.Geo])
  * 1/12 * 'FTE in Dept Calc',
  BLANK
)
```

**Guidance**: When the same `[FILTER: X][FILTER: Y][EXCLUDE: Z]` would repeat on 3+ IFBLANK branches, consider a nested IF that factors the common conditions instead. Benchmarks have shown nested IF can be meaningfully faster in such cases; verify on your workload before committing to either form.

**Rule of thumb**: If you would write the same `[FILTER: X][FILTER: Y][EXCLUDE: Z]` on 3+ branches, consider a nested IF that factors the common conditions instead.

## 3. Logical Operators and 3-State Booleans

### 3.1 Pigment booleans are 3-state

- **TRUE** → dense
- **FALSE** → dense
- **BLANK** → sparse (no value at that coordinate)

Prefer patterns that preserve BLANK as a distinct state (IFBLANK, ISDEFINED, FILTER, EXCLUDE). Avoid turning BLANK into TRUE or FALSE unless necessary.

### 3.2 Avoid NOT in favor of EXCLUDE / positive conditions

**NOT** flips TRUE↔FALSE. For BLANK, NOT has no meaningful opposite; applying NOT to a boolean that can be BLANK densifies (BLANKs become TRUE or FALSE). Prefer EXCLUDE or a positive condition.

**Rule**: Do not write `[FILTER: NOT 'Flag']` or `[FILTER: NOT 'Entity'.'Is_Archived']`. Use:

```pigment
[EXCLUDE: 'Flag']
[EXCLUDE: 'Entity'.'Is_Archived']
```

Same for IF: avoid `IF(NOT 'Entity'.'Flag', 'Metric', BLANK)`. Use `'Metric'[EXCLUDE: 'Entity'.'Flag']`.

**Exception**: When the boolean is known to be TRUE/FALSE (no BLANK values, e.g. imported from an ERP system or explicitly set for every item), `FILTER: NOT 'Flag'` is acceptable and may be more readable. EXCLUDE is the safer default when the boolean's BLANK behavior is uncertain or when sparsity matters.

### 3.3 Sparse boolean masks: IF(condition, TRUE, BLANK)

A bare comparison like `'Metric' = 'Other'` yields a **dense** boolean (TRUE/FALSE everywhere). To keep a **sparse** boolean (TRUE only where the condition holds, BLANK elsewhere):

**Canonical**:

```pigment
IF('Metric' = 'Something Else', TRUE)
// or explicitly
IF('Metric' = 'Something Else', TRUE, BLANK)
```

Use this when you need a sparse "tag" of cells that meet a condition, without densifying the rest to FALSE.
