# Excel → Pigment Modeling Specification

## Purpose

Take one or more Excel files (of any complexity) and produce a comprehensive, implementation-ready
modeling specification for rebuilding the entire workbook as a Pigment application. The spec must
be detailed enough that a Pigment modeler can build the app without referring back to the Excel.

## Why This Skill Exists

Excel models used in enterprise planning are often messy, undocumented, and fragile. They contain
implicit dimensional structures, hidden cross-references, hardcoded assumptions, and accumulated
technical debt. Converting them to Pigment requires careful reverse-engineering — not just listing
the sheets, but understanding the *intent* behind the structure and mapping it to Pigment's
multidimensional paradigm. This skill codifies that reverse-engineering process.

## Workflow Overview

The workflow has 4 phases. Complete them in order. Each phase produces artifacts that feed the next.

```
Phase 1: DISCOVERY     → Inventory the Excel structure
Phase 2: ANALYSIS      → Identify dimensions, data and calculation flows, errors
Phase 3: MAPPING       → Map Excel concepts and data to Pigment
Phase 4: SPECIFICATION → Write the detailed modeling spec
```

---

## Phase 1: DISCOVERY — Inventory the Excel Structure

**Goal:** Build a complete picture of what's in the file before making any modeling decisions.

### 1.1 Read the Excel File(s)

For each sheet, including hidden, collect:

- **Sheet metadata**: name, dimensions (used range), row/column count
- **Sheet intent**: brief description of the sheet role
- **Merged cells**: count and locations (merged cells are a strong signal of reporting/dashboard sheets)
- **Headers**: identify header rows (may not be row 1 — look for the first row where most cells are non-empty strings)
- **Data types per column**: sample 20+ rows to determine types (numeric, text, date, boolean, dimension)
- **Formulas**: count, complexity, cross-sheet references
- **Named ranges**: list all, flag any that resolve to #REF!
- **Data validation / dropdowns**: list ranges with validation rules
- **Independent grids on this sheet**: note every **separate** contiguous data or report block (different headers, spacing, or unrelated topics); assign a **region id** for the spec (§1.2)
- **Charts**: count embedded chart objects; note sheet vs. **regions** (§1.2). For each, capture **§1.4**: intention, format, source data range.

### 1.2 Classify Each Sheet

Assign each sheet to one of these categories:

| Category | Description | Pigment mapping |
|---|---|---|
| **DATA_SOURCE** | Flat tabular data with headers and rows (imports from ERP, HRIS, etc.) | Transaction List or Dimension import |
| **REFERENTIAL** | Lookup/mapping table (accounts, org hierarchy, FTE types) | Dimension List with properties |
| **CALCULATION** | Sheet dominated by formulas computing intermediate or final results | Metrics with formulas |
| **REPORTING** | Dashboard/summary with merged cells, charts, formatting | Board / Table / View |
| **INPUT** | Cells meant for user entry (highlighted, validated, sparsely filled) | Input Metrics on Boards |
| **PARAMETERS** | Configuration sheet (reference year, dropdown lists, settings) | Settings folder, Dimension items, or Input metrics |
| **NAVIGATION** | Menu/separator sheet | For navigation boards |
| **MACRO_SUPPORT** | Objective, Role, VBA timing, logging, or macro control sheet | Modeled only if core calculation/validation process  |

**Heuristics for classification:**
- If >80% of non-empty cells are formulas → CALCULATION
- If merged cells > 10 and sheet has "Reporting", "Overview", "Summary", "Dashboard" → REPORTING
- If sheet has flat headers in row 1 and uniform data below → DATA_SOURCE or REFERENTIAL
- If sheet name starts with "Source_" or "Data" → DATA_SOURCE
- If sheet name contains "Master Data", "Ref_", "List", "Mapping" → REFERENTIAL
- If sheet has data validation or highlighted input areas → INPUT
- If sheet contains navigation buttons or links → NAVIGATION
- If sheet has **embedded charts** (see §1.4) → strong signal for **REPORTING** (or mixed regions)

**Multiple grids on one tab.** A **single sheet** may contain **several** independent data or report areas (e.g. two unrelated tables one under the other, a small parameters block next to a ledger, one pivoted block and one flat table on the same tab). Do **not** assume *one sheet → one* Pigment Transaction List, metric, or Table. Split the tab into **logical regions** (give each a stable id in the spec, e.g. `SheetName + cell range` or `SheetName::Region_A`), classify **each** region separately (it may be DATA_SOURCE, pivoted facts, REPORTING, etc.), and plan **separate** TLs, metrics, **Tables, charts**, and/or Boards as needed. **Data source imports** and build order in the written spec (**Phase 4 — Excel migration annex** and **Implementation**) apply **per region**, not only per sheet name.

### 1.3 Map Cross-Sheet Dependencies

Build a dependency graph:
- For each formula with "!", record source_sheet → target_sheet
- For named ranges, record which sheets reference which
- Identify circular dependencies (rare but critical)
- Identify the "flow direction": data sources → calculations → reporting

Output: a dependency summary showing which sheets feed which.

### 1.4 Chart inventory (for REPORTING / dashboards)

When a sheet contains **embedded charts**, record **each** chart in a compact list. **§3.6** and spec **§8** carry Pigment design (pivot, metrics, board placement).

For **each** chart:

- **Intention**: what it is meant to convey (e.g. “revenue by month”, “mix by product”, Actual vs Budget by cost center).
- **Format**: Excel **chart type** (line, column, bar, stacked column, pie, doughnut, area, scatter, combo, waterfall, …).
- **Source data range**: workbook reference for the chart’s data — **cell range(s)**, **pivot chart** source, or **named range(s)** Excel binds to the series and categories.

---

## Phase 2: ANALYSIS — Identify Dimensions, Data Flows, Errors

### 2.1 Extract Candidate Dimensions

Scan DATA_SOURCE and REFERENTIAL sheets for columns that are categorical (repeating values), **per logical region** when a tab holds multiple grids (§1.2).
Apply the cardinality analysis from Pigment fundamentals:

```
For each column:
  cardinality_ratio = unique_values / total_rows
  
  If ratio < 0.8 and values repeat → candidate Dimension
  If ratio ≈ 1.0 and text         → candidate Text property
  If numeric                       → candidate Number property / Metric value
  If date                          → candidate Date property
  If boolean or yes/no             → candidate Boolean property
```

**Cross-validate dimensions across sheets.** If "Cost Center" appears as a column in 5 different source sheets,
it's almost certainly a dimension. If "Cost Center" also appears in a REFERENTIAL sheet with properties like
"Cost Center name", "Entity", "Division" → that's the dimension definition.

**Canonical names: master data wins.** When different Excel labels refer to the **same** entity (abbreviation vs full name, “Region A” in a DATA_SOURCE vs “Region A – North” on a REFERENTIAL row, typos, or legacy synonyms), do **not** treat each spelling as a different Pigment item. Pick the **name (or code) defined on the master / REFERENTIAL** sheet as the single canonical value for specs, imports, `tool:add_list_items` rows, and `tool:set_metric_input` coordinates. List every alias discovered in the workbook in the spec (Excel raw value → canonical master name) so execution never forks duplicate members.

### 2.2 Identify Hierarchies

Look for patterns that indicate parent-child hierarchies:
- REFERENTIAL sheets with columns like "L4 → L3 → L2 → L1 → Account" (multi-level account hierarchy)
- Organization tables with "Cost Center → Entity → Division"
- Named ranges with "List_xxx" that enumerate dimension items
- Columns whose values are a subset of another column's values

### 2.3 Identify the Time Dimension

Look for:
- Column headers that are years (2025, 2026, ...) or months (Jan, Feb, Jul-25, ...)
- Columns named "Year", "Month", "Quarter", "Period"
- Named ranges referencing years
- Fiscal year patterns (FY26, Q1/26, H1)

Determine the **time granularity** needed: annual, quarterly, monthly, or mixed.
Note any fiscal year offsets (e.g., FY starting in July).

### 2.4 Identify Metrics vs Properties

**Long-format / “database” columns** (each numeric column is one measure or each row adds one fact with dimension values in dedicated columns):

- If the column represents a *measure* that varies by the dimensional combinations (Amount, FTE count, Cost) and each **row** is a grain you will keep in Pigment → it is usually modeled as a **Property** (Dimension or Transaction) and aggregated into metrics with formulas
- If the column represents a *fixed attribute* of a dimension item (Account code, Sort order) → it's a **Property** on a Dimension or on list items.

**Pivoted / “matrix” layouts** (two categorical axes: one dimension along **rows**, another along **columns** — e.g. products down, months across — with **numeric values only in the interior cells**). A sheet may contain **more than one** such block; treat each as its own mapping target (§1.2).

- This shape matches a **Metric** or **Table** view in Pigment: row header dimension × column header dimension (often including **time in the column headers**).
- The practical load path for that grid is usually **`set_metric_input`**: each non-empty cell becomes a coordinate (row item, column item) plus a value. See §3.8 for volume: very large grids may require multiple `set_metric_input` calls (chunking) or a redesign (unpivot → Transaction List + formulas).

**Table-shaped DATA_SOURCE** (header row + many data rows; every column is a field, **no** measure “spread” across a second dimension in the header row); **scope to one logical region** if the sheet has several (§1.2):

- Model as **Transaction List** (or Dimension items + properties when it is master data).
- To **import** rows: use **`add_list_items`** only — successive tool calls with **at most 100 rows per `rows` payload** until all Excel rows are loaded (large sheets require many batches).

**Calculated properties** on dimension or transaction lists (formula columns on REFERENTIAL or table-shaped sheets, not only CALCULATION sheets):

- Inspect each column: if **every populated cell uses the same formula** (same structure; only row-relative references differ), create the property, **exclude that column from import**, and set a **list property formula** once input properties on that list exist.
- If formulas **vary materially** across rows (different functions, layouts, or row-specific logic), do **not** force one property formula — import the column values with `add_list_items` as an input property instead.
- In the spec, label each list property **input** or **calculated** (with the Pigment formula when calculated).

### 2.5 Detect Errors and Red Flags

This is critical for building user trust. Actively look for:

| Error type | How to detect | Severity |
|---|---|---|
| **#REF! in named ranges** | Named range attr_text contains "#REF!" | HIGH — broken references, likely from deleted sheets |
| **#REF! in formulas** | Cell values containing "#REF!" | HIGH — broken calculations |
| **#DIV/0!, #VALUE!, #NAME?** | Cell values or formula errors | MEDIUM — formula bugs |
| **"Check to zero" cells ≠ 0** | Cells labeled "check to zero" or "control" with non-zero values | HIGH — model doesn't balance |
| **Missing dimension values** | Null/empty cells in categorical columns | MEDIUM — incomplete data |
| **Inconsistent naming** | Same entity spelled differently across sheets (e.g., "Nearshoring PL" vs "Nearshoring Poland") | MEDIUM — must normalize to the **master / REFERENTIAL** name (or code) before import; see §2.1 |
| **Orphan sheets** | Sheets not referenced by any formula and not referencing others | LOW — possibly obsolete |
| **Excessive merged cells** | >50 merged cell ranges in a sheet | LOW — complicates parsing |
| **100% empty Projet column** | A dimension column that is empty in all rows | HIGH — missing mandatory dimension |
| **Broken named ranges ratio** | >30% of named ranges are #REF! | HIGH — significant technical debt |
| **Hardcoded values in formulas** | Formulas containing literal numbers instead of cell references | LOW — reduces flexibility |
| **Circular references** | Formulas that reference themselves (directly or indirectly) | HIGH — may produce incorrect results |

**Report errors prominently** at the start of the spec. This builds confidence.

### 2.6 Detect Calculation Logic Patterns

Scan CALCULATION sheets for common patterns:
- **Aggregation**: Use views to naturally aggregate across dimension properties, or BY mapping in formula
- **VLOOKUP/INDEX-MATCH/XLOOKUP**: Dimension properties in formulas or ITEM()
- **IF/IFS/SWITCH**:  IF/SWITCH formulas
- **OFFSET/INDIRECT**: Combination of properties and BY mappings
- **SUMPRODUCT/SUMIFS**: BY modifier
- **Cumulative (running totals)**: → CUMULATE function
- **Year-over-year/shifts**: SELECT modifier (e.g. `Revenue[SELECT: Month - 12]`)
- **Sensitivity toggles**: Cells that select an item in a list → Input metric of type Dimension

## Phase 3: MAPPING — Map Excel Concepts to Pigment Concepts

### 3.1 Dimension List Design

For each identified dimension, define:
- **Name**: follow Pigment naming conventions
- **Source**: which Excel sheet/column provides the items
- **Properties**: columns from the REFERENTIAL sheet that become properties
- **Property types**: apply cardinality analysis to determine Dimension-type vs Text/Number
- **Unique property**: which property identifies items for imports (usually Code or Name)
- **Aliases**: any non-master labels seen in DATA_SOURCE or CALCULATION sheets → map each to the **canonical** name/code from this REFERENTIAL (§2.1)

### 3.2 Transaction List Design

For each **distinct table-shaped** DATA_SOURCE **region** on a tab (see §1.2 and §2.4 — not pivoted matrices; those belong under **Metric Design**):

- **Region** / **Source**: which Excel sheet and range (or named area) defines this single grid
- **Name**: follow Pigment naming conventions (one Transaction List per **region**, not necessarily per sheet)
- **Dimension-type properties**: which columns link to which Dimension Lists (values normalized to **canonical** master names per §2.1)
- **Numeric properties**: which columns hold measure values
- **Expected row count**: approximate volume for performance planning (informs the load path in §3.8)

### 3.3 Metric Design

For each **metric** (calculated or input), including **each** pivoted fact block when a tab holds several grids (§1.2) — **each** block may be its own metric or feed a distinct structure:

- **Name** follow Pigment naming conventions
- **Type**: Number, Date, Text, Boolean, Dimension
- **Structure** (dimensions): which Dimension Lists define the metric structure (max 5 recommended)
- **Formula logic**: describe in natural language + pseudo-Pigment syntax
- **Aggregator**: Sum, Avg, Advanced Aggregator, etc.
- **Data source**: if populated from a Transaction List, specify the BY aggregation
- **Input vs Calculated**: is this user-entered or formula-driven?
- **Planned write path**: for user-entered (input) metrics, state whether values should be loaded via `tool:set_metric_input` (moderate cell counts) or derived from lists/metrics instead (see §3.8). **Pivoted Excel grids** (§2.4) are the primary case for `tool:set_metric_input`.
- **Excel region** (when the tab has multiple blocks): sheet + range for **this** metric’s source grid (§1.2)

### 3.4 Table Design

For reporting views that group metrics (P&L, Summary). **One Excel tab may contain several unrelated report layouts** (side-by-side blocks, stacked summaries): model **one** Pigment **Table** (and associated views) per **distinct** reporting region (§1.2), not one Table per sheet by default.

For each table:
- **Excel region** (optional but required when the sheet has multiple grids): sheet name + range identifying **this** report block (§1.2)
- **Name**: follow Pigment naming conventions
- **Metrics included**: list the metrics
- **Calculated items**: any derived rows (e.g., "Net Revenue = Gross Sales - Trade Investment")
- **View pivot (target layout)**: for the table’s primary **View**, specify which dimensions belong on **rows**, **columns**, and **pages** (page = selectors / filters that scope the whole view without adding a row or column axis). Align with how the Excel report is read left-to-right and top-to-bottom.
- **Sorting**: default sort on row and/or column axes where it matters (e.g. hierarchy order, chronological time, custom account sequence); note any Excel-implied order to preserve.
- **Filtering**: view- or axis-level filters to mirror the workbook (slices, excluded members, “actuals only”, version, etc.) and whether null/zero rows or columns should be hidden for parity with Excel.

### 3.5 Board Design (high-level)

For each REPORTING sheet, suggest:
- **Board name**: mapped from the Excel sheet name
- **Widgets**: metrics, tables, **charts** (each specified in **§3.6**), KPI cards, text
- **Page Selector**: dimensions in page selectors at board level
- **Layout**: ordered widget list

### 3.6 Chart design (Board-ready visualizations)

Expand **§1.4** (intention, format, source data range) into a full Pigment plan for **each** chart (and any chart implied by a REPORTING region without a formal chart object but built from a pivot chart range):

- **Analysis — what is shown**: clear description for implementers (trend, composition, variance, ranking, correlation, etc.) and the **business question** the chart answers.
- **Excel chart format → Pigment chart type**: map Excel **line / column / bar / stacked / pie / doughnut / area / scatter / combo** (etc.) to the **closest Pigment visualization**; call out **secondary axis**, **stacked** vs **clustered**, and **100%** layouts where relevant.
- **Underlying data**: which **Pigment metrics**, **Table**, or **View** must power the chart (names / ids); ensure those blocks exist **before** the chart is wired.
- **Chart pivot** (mirror **View** configuration): specify dimensions on **rows**, **columns**, and **pages** (selectors); which field drives **series** / **color** / **legend**; **category axis** ordering (time order, hierarchy, custom); **filters** (versions, scenarios, top members) so the dataset matches the Excel slice.
- **Formatting parity** (when important): notable colors, data labels, axis titles — only what affects readability or sign-off.
- **Board placement**: target **Board** (§3.5), **slot** in the widget order, and **spatial relationship** to neighboring tables (e.g. “chart above Table X as in Excel”).

### 3.7 Calendar Configuration

Based on the time analysis:
- **Granularity**: monthly, quarterly, annual
- **Range**: start year to end year
- **Fiscal year**: does it align with calendar year?
- **Properties**: Quarter, Half-Year, Year as properties of Month

### 3.8 Data load mapping

**Goal:** After the conceptual mapping (lists, metrics, calendars), the implementation plan must name **how** data lands in Pigment when an agent executes the migration. Pick tools by **volume** and **shape** (grid inputs vs tabular rows).

| Need | MCP tool | When to use | Limits / notes |
|------|----------|-------------|----------------|
| **Metric input values** (user-entered cells on a defined metric structure) | `tool:set_metric_input` | **Pivoted Excel grids** (§2.4) and other **low-to-moderate** coordinate sets: each call carries rows of dimension values + cell values. | Not for **table-shaped** fact sheets (use lists). Very large pivots: chunk multiple calls or unpivot → TL + formulas (§2.4). |
| **Append rows to a Dimension or Transaction List** | `tool:add_list_items` | **Table-shaped** list imports: data is supplied as **headers + row arrays** in the tool payload. | **At most 100 rows per tool call** (maximum length enforced on the `rows` argument). Larger sheets: **only** repeated calls with ≤100 rows each until the dataset is exhausted. |

**Guidelines**

- **Pivoted sheets** (§2.4) → **`tool:set_metric_input`** on the target **input** metric; **table-shaped** sources → **`tool:add_list_items`** in batches of ≤100 rows per call.
- For every **table-shaped DATA_SOURCE** **region** (§1.2), the spec must spell out **`tool:add_list_items`** batching (row order, headers, and how many calls for the expected row count).
- **`tool:add_list_items`** and **`tool:set_metric_input`** payloads must use **canonical** dimension item names/codes from master data (§2.1)
- **Formula-driven metrics** are not “written” row-by-row with these tools; they are defined with formulas (other MCP tools). Reserve `tool:set_metric_input` for **input** metrics.
- **Calculated list properties** (§2.4): omit from `add_list_items`; set the property formula after the list and its input properties exist.

---

## Phase 4: SPECIFICATION — Write the Detailed Modeling Spec

### 4.1 Spec document structure (aligned with `tool:rewrite_specifications`)

The written spec MUST follow this outline: **## Summary**, **## Architecture**, then one **`## Application: …`** block per Pigment application, each with **Blocks and Folders** → **Views** → **Boards**

Cross-read **[modeling_architecture_design.md]** (Pillars 3–4: data cycle, governance, **Hub vs spokes**) and **[modeling_principles.md]** (Hub pattern, Library folder) before fixing **Architecture** and deciding which blocks live in **Hub** vs **spoke** apps.

```markdown
# Pigment Modeling Specification
## Source: [Excel filename(s)]
## Generated: [date]

## Summary
[Narrative goal of the Excel migration.] Key outcomes, scope, and **risks** (data quality, complexity, deadlines).

## Architecture
**Applications & Hub decision**:
- **Single app vs multi-app:** State whether the workspace uses **one application** or **Hub + one or more spokes** (use cases, ownership, sensitivity per architecture skill).
- **Hub / master data:**: a **Hub** holds **shared dimensions** (referential / master lists, **Version** if used, organizational & chart-of-accounts dimensions reused across apps, Calendar-related structural choices when centralized). **Spoke** apps hold use-case-specific **metrics**, **transaction lists** loaded for that process, **tables**, and reporting **views/boards**, unless transactional data must be **shared across apps** (then Hub placement may apply — state why).
- **Excel mapping:** Which **REFERENTIAL / DATA_SOURCE** regions (§1.2) land in **Hub** dimensions vs **spoke** TLs; call out **canonical names** (§2.1).
- **Data flow:** Short diagram in words: Excel → imports (**§ Data source imports**) → lists/metrics → tables → views/charts → boards; mention **Library** / `PUSH_` / `PULL_` if multi-app sharing applies.

## Excel migration annex (traceability — optional subsection before Application blocks)
Use this block so Excel specifics are not lost; keep it **after Architecture** and **before** the first `## Application`.

### Error & quality report
[Brief reference to Phase 2 findings — or “clean”.]

### Multi-grid & chart index
- **Regions** per sheet (§1.2); **charts** (§1.4 recap: intention, format, source range).

### Data source imports (execution)
- **Per Excel region** (§1.2): pivoted → **`tool:set_metric_input`**; table-shaped → **`tool:add_list_items`** in batches of **≤100 rows**; order after target blocks exist.
- Do not merge unrelated regions on one tab into a single list/metric.

---

## Application: `Hub` — *omit this heading when everything fits a single non-Hub app; use `Hub` or `Master data` display name when a separate Hub is required*

### Blocks and Folders

| Action | Object | Type | Role | Reason |
|--------|--------|------|------|--------|
| create/reuse/edit/delete | `name` (mention if known) | dimension, transaction list, metric, table, block folder, board folder | input/processing/output / shared master | e.g. shared **referential** from Excel REFERENTIAL sheets; **Version** dimension in Hub per scenarios skill |

*Do not list **view** or **board** rows here — use **Views** and **Boards** below.*

### Views (when this app has reporting widgets)

| # | Action | View | Block | Rows | Columns | Pages | Chart type |
|---|--------|------|-------|------|---------|-------|------------|
| 1 | create/reuse/… | `View name` | `Metric or table` (metric/table) | … | … | … | Grouped Bar chart, Stacked Bar chart, Line chart, Combined chart, Pie Chart, Waterfall chart, or `—` |

*For charts, align **View name** with **Boards** widget plan; chart type column matches Pigment chart types.*

### Boards (when relevant)
Repeat per board with a `### Board: …` heading. **Widget plan:** one row per widget, **screen order** (left → right, top → bottom).

| # | Action | Widget | View | Widget type | Width x Height |
|---|--------|--------|------|-------------|----------------|
| 1 | create/edit | Label | same `View` as in **Views** or `—` | Grid, Chart, List, KPI, spacer, action, image, single text, dimensioned text | e.g. 12×3 |

---

## Application: `[Primary planning / use-case app]` — *repeat the three subsections for each spoke*

### Blocks and Folders
[Same table pattern — TLs and metrics consumed by this use case, folders per modeling_principles.]

### Views
[Same **Views** table — include chart types on views that feed Chart widgets.]

### Boards
[Same **Boards** widget plan — reference §3.6 / Excel chart intentions.]

---

## Application: `[Second spoke if any]`
*Same three subsections — omit when not applicable.*

---

## Implementation
### Phase 1 (and further phases as needed)
- **Build order:** Hub **shared dimensions** (and shared blocks) **before** spoke metrics that reference them; **imports** after target lists/metrics exist.
- Call out **Excel region → Pigment object** for major loads.
- Reporting: underlying **metrics/tables/views** before **Board** chart/table widgets.

## Notes (optional)
Open questions, parity exceptions.

## Appendix
- Sheet classification & **multi-grid tab index** (§1.2)
- Named ranges inventory (errors #REF!, etc.)
- Cross-sheet dependency summary
- Full error list
```

### 4.2 Guidelines for a Successful Plan

- **Be specific.** Don't write "create a metric for costs" — write `CALC_Total_Cost` dimensioned by `CostCenter × AccountREP × Month × Version` with formula `LOAD_Budget_Charges.Total_Cout_KEUR[BY SUM: ...]`.
- **Include the Excel-to-Pigment mapping** for every element. The reader should be able to trace any Pigment object back to the exact Excel sheet/cell/column it came from.
- **Flag decisions.** When the mapping is ambiguous (e.g., a column could be a dimension or a property), explain both options and recommend one with reasoning.
- **Use Pigment naming conventions** from the modeling-pigment-applications skill.
- **Challenge structures with >5 dimensions.** If a metric would need 6+ dimensions, suggest alternatives (properties, mapped dimensions).
- **Always propose to model "the Pigment way".** Importing an Excel file does not mean useing the literal idiosyncracies of Excel, and you should always plan to use idiomatic Pigment patterns instead of a direct translation.

---

## Critical Reminders

- **Written spec shape:** Phase 4 output must match **`rewrite_specifications`** (Summary, Architecture with **Hub vs spoke**, then per-app **Blocks and Folders** → **Views** → **Boards**). Shared **master / referential** dimensions from Excel usually belong in a **Hub** when multiple apps or reuse are anticipated — see **modeling_architecture_design.md** Pillar 4.
- **Always read the writing-pigment-formulas skill** before writing formula pseudo-code. Pigment has its own formula language — never use Excel syntax in the spec.
- **Never assume a clean Excel.** Headers may not be in row 1. Data may start at row 7. Columns may be hidden. Sheets may be named misleadingly.
- **The error report is not optional.** Even if the file is clean, state that explicitly. If there are errors, report them prominently — this builds trust.
- **Cross-validate dimensions across all sheets.** A dimension that appears in 1 source sheet is suspect; one that appears in 5 is reliable.
- **One canonical name per entity.** When labels differ, use the **master / REFERENTIAL** name (or code) everywhere (§2.1).
- **Multiple grids on one tab** (§1.2): plan **separate** Pigment objects and import sequences per region — don’t assume one sheet → one TL or one Table.
