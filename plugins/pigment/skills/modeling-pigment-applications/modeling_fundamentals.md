# Pigment Core Concepts

## 1. General Vision: Pigment as a Multidimensional Engine

Pigment is an in-memory multidimensional engine designed for planning, simulation, and real-time analysis. It is built on four core principles:

- **Everything is multidimensional:** Metrics exist within a dimensional space, where a cell represents a combination of elements from a set of dimensions.

- **Real-time calculations:** Changes to inputs, parameters, or imports trigger instant recalculations of dependent formulas.

- **Granular models + scenarios:** Supports detailed models (transactions, employees) alongside native version/scenario support.

- **Collaborative interface:** Data is exposed through boards containing multi-metric tables, charts, and workflows.

## 2. Pigment Modeling Building Blocks

Pigment applications are built from four core components:

- **Dimensions**: Analysis axes containing items (Product, Employee, Month) with properties
- **Metrics**: Multidimensional grids for calculations, inputs, and reporting
- **Transaction Lists**: High-volume granular data storage (orders, invoices, movements)
- **Tables**: Containers organizing multiple metrics with shared dimensions for analysis

### 2.1 Dimensions and Properties

**Dimensions** are analysis axes (Month, Account, Product, Employee) containing items (rows) and **Properties** (columns).

#### Property Data Types

Properties can be Number, Boolean, Text, Date, or **Dimension type** (referencing another dimension).

**Property Type Selection:**

- **Number**: Monetary values, quantities, measurements, ratios
- **Date**: Temporal fields, timestamps
- **Text**: Free-form descriptive content
- **Dimension**: Categorical, hierarchical, reference fields that group/classify items
- **Boolean**: True/false flags

**Selection Rule:**

Use **Dimension type** when property values reference or categorize items (Department, Region, Category, fields ending in Id/Code). Use **Text/Number/Date/Boolean** for measures, attributes, and free-form content (Discount %, Lead time, descriptions).

#### Cardinality-Based Property Type Selection

Use data-driven cardinality analysis to determine property types:

**Step 1: Calculate Cardinality Ratio**

```
For each property:
  cardinality_ratio = (number of unique values) / (total number of rows)
```

**Step 2: Apply Classification Rules**

| Cardinality Pattern                           | Data Characteristics                                    | Property Type      | Action Required                                                        |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Categorical** (< 0.8 with repeating values) | Values repeat across rows, indicating categories/groups | **Dimension**      | Create parent dimension with unique values as items, then reference it |
| **Numeric**                                   | Numbers: integers, decimals, percentages, quantities    | **Number/Integer** | Use directly                                                           |
| **Temporal**                                  | Dates, timestamps, time values                          | **Date**           | Use directly                                                           |
| **Binary**                                    | True/false, yes/no, 0/1                                 | **Boolean**        | Use directly                                                           |
| **High-cardinality** (> 0.8, mostly unique)   | Unique per row, free-form text, descriptions            | **Text**           | Use directly                                                           |

**Key Rule:** If ANY value repeats across rows (ratio < 1.0), check if it's categorical. Even at 0.5-0.8 cardinality, repeating values indicate categories → use Dimension type.

**Step 3: Detect Hierarchical Patterns**

Indicators that suggest Dimension type:

- Dot notation in property names (e.g., `Parent.Child`, `Group.Subgroup`)
- Property names ending in common grouping terms
- Values that represent categories, groups, or classifications

**Step 4: Workflow for Dimension-Type Properties**

When cardinality analysis indicates Dimension type:

1. **Extract** unique values from the property
2. **Create** parent dimension using those unique values as items
3. **Reference** parent dimension ID when creating child dimension property
4. **Populate** child dimension data

**Example Cardinality Analysis:**

| Property    | Unique Values | Total Rows | Ratio | Pattern              | Type          |
| ----------- | ------------- | ---------- | ----- | -------------------- | ------------- |
| Name        | 10            | 10         | 1.0   | Unique identifiers   | Text          |
| GroupA      | 4             | 10         | 0.4   | Repeating categories | **Dimension** |
| GroupB      | 7             | 10         | 0.7   | Repeating categories | **Dimension** |
| Rate        | 8             | 10         | 0.8   | Numeric measures     | Number        |
| Description | 10            | 10         | 1.0   | Free-form text       | Text          |

#### Other Property Considerations

**Unique Properties**: Dimensions can have properties marked as "unique" (e.g., Code, Name) to identify items for imports and integrations.

**Calendar**: Each application includes a calendar made up of time dimensions and properties. Always reuse these existing calendar dimensions instead of creating new ones to ensure consistency and optimal performance.

### 2.2 Metrics

Metrics are the central blocks for modeling, data input, calculation, and reporting. Like properties, a metric is defined by a data type (Number, Boolean, Text, Date, Dimension).

**Metric Type Selection Guide:**

- **Number**: Financial values, KPIs, quantities, forecasts, calculations
- **Date**: Milestones, deadlines, temporal tracking fields
- **Text**: Status indicators, categorical outputs, labels
- **Dimension**: Reference fields linking to dimension items
- **Boolean**: Flags, toggles, binary states

**Anatomy of a Metric:**

- **Structure:** The structure is defined by dimension lists creating a multidimensional grid (e.g., Country × Product × Month). Remember: transaction lists CANNOT be used as structural dimensions—only regular dimensions (dimension lists) are allowed.

- **Data Input:** Can be manual (overrides computed values), imported, or computed via formula.

- **Scenarios:** Tracks multiple versions of the same metric.

- **Sparsity:** Only relevant combinations store values; blanks are not stored.

**Default Aggregators:**

Metrics define how values aggregate across dimensions (Sum, Avg, Min, Max, Count, First/Last Non Blank).

**Common Use Cases:**

- **Input & Calculation:** Capturing assumptions and performing intermediate logic (e.g., seasonality adjustments, allocation rules).

- **Reporting:** KPIs, dashboards, and analytical views across multiple dimensions.

- **Planning:** Financial planning (budget, cash flow), workforce planning (headcount, capacity), supply chain planning (inventory, orders), sales planning (forecasts, quotas), and operational planning (utilization, resources).

### 2.3 Transaction Lists

Transaction Lists store granular, atomic records (e.g., invoices, orders, HR events, inventory movements) and act as the "fact tables" of the system.

**Key Characteristics:**

- **Non-Structural:** They cannot be used as structural dimensions in a Metric. **⚠️ Critical: A metric must NEVER be dimensioned over a Transaction List.** Transaction Lists are fundamentally different from Dimensions (dimension lists). They are data containers, not structural axes.

- **High Volume:** Designed to hold millions of rows, unlike standard Dimensions.

- **No Unique ID:** Unlike Dimensions, they do not require a unique identifier per item.

#### Dimension list vs Transaction list: impact on metrics

**Common points:** Both are types of Lists in Pigment. Both contain Items and can have Properties. Both organize and structure data in the model.

**Differences:**

- **Dimension list:** Defines the structure of your data (analysis axes: Country, Product, Month, etc.). Each Item must be unique. Can be used as dimensions in Metrics and Tables. Reusable across the Application.
- **Transaction list:** Stores events or transactional data (orders, HR records, accounting entries). Items do not need to be unique. **Cannot be used as dimensions in Metrics**—only referenced in formulas. Designed for high-volume, transactional data.

A Transaction List (TL) is **not** a dimension. It therefore **cannot** be a structural dimension of a metric. Only **dimension lists** can appear in a metric's structure. Transaction lists are referenced **inside metric formulas** to aggregate their properties toward dimensions (via the `BY` modifier).

**Correct pattern:** With a Transaction List `Sales` that has properties `Country` and `Month` (both of type Dimension) and a numeric property `Value`, the correct syntax for a metric that aggregates by Country and Month is:

```pigment
Sales.Value[BY SUM: Sales.Country, Sales.Month]
```

The metric is dimensioned by Country × Month (or by the dimensions referenced by those properties), and the formula references the TL and aggregates with BY.

**Anti-pattern:** Using the list itself as a dimension in BY:

```pigment
Sales.Value[BY SUM: Sales]  // ❌ Error: Sales is not a dimension
```

This causes a syntax error or invalid behavior: `Sales` is not a dimension, so you cannot aggregate "by Sales". You must list the TL's **properties** that are of type Dimension (or expressions such as `TIMEDIM(...)` for dates) in the BY clause.

**Primary Usage:**

- **Data Imports:** The main destination for granular ERP/CRM/data warehouse data.

- **Aggregation:** Data is rolled up into Metrics using formulas (e.g., `Orders.Amount [BY SUM: Orders.Product, Orders.Month]`).

- **Drill-Down:** Allows users to view underlying details contributing to aggregated metrics.

**Best Practices:**

- **Never dimension a metric over a Transaction List.** Unlike regular Dimensions (dimension lists), Transaction Lists cannot be used in a metric's dimensional structure. Only dimension lists can be structural elements of metrics.
- Use transaction lists for high-volume transactional data instead of creating massive dimensions
- Always aggregate transaction list data to metrics for analysis and reporting
- Consider versioning strategies when transaction data needs historical tracking

### 2.4 Tables

Tables are containers that group multiple metrics together, enabling unified analysis and consistent dimensional structure.

**Key Characteristics:**

- **Shared Dimensions:** All metrics in a table share at least a common dimension
- **Calculated Items:** Create derived rows/columns using formulas across table metrics
- **Single View:** Present related metrics together (Revenue, Cost, Margin in one table)

**Primary Usage:**

- **Financial Statements:** P&L, Balance Sheet, Cash Flow with multiple line items
- **Planning Models:** Combine inputs, calculations, and outputs in one structure
- **Reporting:** Multi-metric dashboards with consistent dimensional breakdown

**Table vs Standalone Metrics:**

| Aspect               | Table                                     | Standalone Metrics                     |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Structure**        | Shared dimensions across all metrics      | Each metric has independent dimensions |
| **Calculated Items** | Formula-based rows/columns across metrics | Not available                          |
| **Presentation**     | Unified view of related metrics           | Individual metric views                |
| **Use Case**         | Financial models, complex reports         | Simple KPIs, intermediate calculations |

**Best Practices:**

- Use tables for metrics that belong together logically (P&L Metrics)
- Leverage calculated items for derived metrics (Revenue - Cost = Margin)
- Keep intermediate calculations as standalone metrics, not in reporting tables

## 3. Sparsity: Core Engine Principle

Pigment is a **sparse engine**: it only stores and processes cells with actual values. Empty cells remain blank (not zeros or FALSE).

**Core principle:** Only relevant dimensional combinations carry values.

**Why it matters:**

- Not every product sells in every country in every period
- Not every employee works in every department
- Sparse storage enables billions of potential cells with only millions actually stored

**Advantages over dense engines:**

- Faster calculations (only populated cells processed)
- Better scalability (less storage)
- No dimension limits (competitors often cap at 10-12 dimensions)

**Working with sparsity:**

- **Use `IFDEFINED`** - Checks values exist without densifying
- **Avoid `ISBLANK`** - Returns TRUE/FALSE for ALL cells, creates density
- **Leave ELSE blank** - `IF(condition, value)` without ELSE preserves sparsity
- **Avoid `IF(..., 0)` patterns** - Fills sparse cells unnecessarily
