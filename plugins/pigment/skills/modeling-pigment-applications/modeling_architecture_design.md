# Pigment Architecture Design

**Purpose:** Design a complete Pigment architecture by systematically gathering requirements and making architectural decisions across five pillars. Architecture serves as a high-level blueprint for builders and developers: it defines what needs to be built without prescribing every detail.

**Core principle:** Architecture precedes building. **Dimensional structure is the foundation** that defines UX, performance, calculations, and data handling. Getting it wrong requires rebuilding everything.

---

## What an Architecture Defines

An architecture in Pigment is a high-level blueprint that follows Pigment best practices and aligns with how the Pigment engine works. It must define:

| Component                 | Description                                                                                    |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Dimensional structure** | Which dimensions are in metric structures; granularity; use of properties vs mapped dimensions |
| **Data flows**            | How data moves through the system                                                              |
| **Applications**          | Which applications to create and how they relate (hub vs spokes)                               |
| **Functionalities**       | Use cases and how data flows within each                                                       |
| **End user activity**     | Which functionality end users interact with, especially input data                             |

The **dimensional structure of the matrix is the most critical architectural decision**. It must be determined before starting an application because it defines UX, performance, calculations, and data handling.

---

## Architectural Process

Work through **each pillar systematically**: gather requirements and make decisions before proceeding to the next. Do not skip pillars.

---

## Pillar 1: Dimensional Structure

**Objective:** Define which dimensions belong in metric structures before building begins.

For detailed guidance on dimensions, properties, and hierarchies, see [modeling_dimensions_and_hierarchies.md](./modeling_dimensions_and_hierarchies.md) and [modeling_fundamentals.md](./modeling_fundamentals.md).

### Key Decisions

- Which dimensions are **required in the structure**?
- What is the **granularity** of each dimension (month vs quarter, country vs region, etc.)?
- Can any dimensions be **replaced with properties** or **mapped dimensions**?

### Standard Dimensions to Consider

| Dimension             | Typical use                                                                                                                                                 |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Version**           | Present on almost every metric (Actuals, Budget, Forecast, etc.)                                                                                            |
| **Time**              | Managed by Pigment Calendar native feature. Month is most common; week/day in some cases; quarter/year are usually properties of month, aggregated in views |
| **Organization**      | Cost center, department, or team level; in finance, often a mix of cost center and department                                                               |
| **Chart of accounts** | For finance use cases (cost types)                                                                                                                          |
| **Other**             | Country, product, employee, or use-case-specific dimensions                                                                                                 |

### Design Rules

- **Minimize dimensions** — Rarely more than 5 per metric. If more than 5, challenge whether dimensions can be inferred from properties or use mapped-dimension features.
- **Use properties for aggregations** — What you report on is not necessarily what goes in the structure. Example: plan at month level -> only month in structure; quarter and year are properties of month, aggregated in views. Example: country in structure, region as property of country.
- **Use mapped dimensions when mappings change over time** — e.g. employee moving cost centers: create a metric by Employee x Month x Version with type Dimension (Cost Center); use this in views to display data in the correct cost center over time.
- **Access rights drive structure** — If access is driven at country level, country must be in the structure.
- **Challenge any structure with more than 5 dimensions.**

### Questions to Ask When Information Is Missing

- At what level of granularity will users **input data** for each business dimension?
- At what level of granularity will **calculations** occur?
- Do dimension item mappings **change over time** (e.g. employee moving cost centers)?
- What level drives **user access rights**?
- Are there organizational hierarchies with **varying granularity** needs (some departments drive access at lower levels)?

---

## Pillar 2: End User UX

**Objective:** Let desired user experience drive architectural decisions. Pigment is highly flexible; architecture choices must be guided by the desired end user experience.

### Input and Planning UX

- On which dimensions do users need to **input**?
- How should dimensions be organized in the view (**columns vs rows**)?
- Do users need to see **parent dimensions** while inputting?
- Do users need **simultaneous widgets** with aligned dimensions?
- Does data need **pre-population**?

These requirements directly influence which dimensions go in the metric structure and how tables are organized.

### Reporting and Display

- What are the **key final reports** (e.g. P&L)?
- What **variations** are shown (budget vs forecast vs actuals)?
- What **KPIs and calculations** are required?
- Can calculations use **calculated items** and **"show value as"** features?

**Best practice:** Do not create aggregated metrics when not necessary.
**Avoid creating aggregated metrics when view capabilities can achieve the same result.** Views offer powerful aggregation, grouping, and calculation features (grouping by properties, Show Value As, Calculated Items) that eliminate the need for many "helper" or "reporting" metrics.
**Why this matters:**

- **Reduces model complexity** — fewer metrics = easier maintenance
- **Improves performance** — fewer calculations to compute and store
- **Better separation of concerns** — model focuses on core logic; views handle presentation and ad-hoc analysis
- **More flexible** — users can pivot/group/calculate in views without rebuilding the model

### When to Use Views Instead of Creating Metrics

**Anti-pattern (unnecessary metric):**

```
Metric: Revenue (by Country)
Metric: Revenue by Region  <-- UNNECESSARY
```

**Best practice (use view grouping):**

- Keep only `Revenue (by Country)`
- In the view, **group by** `Country.Region` property (either in Rows, Columns or Pages)
- The view will automatically aggregate Revenue to the Region level

**Rule:** If a dimension has a parent hierarchy or property (e.g., Country -> Region, Employee -> Department), do **not** create separate metrics for parent levels. Use view grouping or pivoting.

**Best practice:** Maximize use of **calculated items** and **show value as**:

- Use **calculated items** for calculations between items or modalities of a dimension (e.g., FY 2027 vs FY 2026, Actual vs Forecast) in report views.
- Use **show value as** for display transformations: temporal comparisons, cumulative series, offsets, differences from another item or metric, and derived presentations of a single metric when the view supports it (e.g., YTD). Avoid extra metrics when the display is sufficient and not needed downstream.

### Workflow and Access Rights

- If access rights need to **change between workflow steps**, separate logic and input into different metrics.

### Questions to Ask When Information Is Missing

- Can you provide **wireframes or mockups** of the desired input screens?
- Can you share **examples of current reports** before Pigment?
- What variations need to appear as **columns** in reports?
- What **KPIs or ratios** are required, and how are they calculated?
- Do certain calculations require **separate metrics** vs calculated items?
- What **workflow steps** exist, and do access rights need to change between steps?

---

## Pillar 3: Data and Its Cycle

**Objective:** Understand data sources, granularity, and transformation requirements.

### Data Sources and Where They Load

| Data type                        | Typical load target                            | Examples                                             |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Transactional data**           | Transaction lists                              | GL from ERPs, HR roster, CRM (e.g. Salesforce)       |
| **Metadata**                     | Dimensions (loaded separately; requires codes) | Products, cost centers, chart of accounts            |
| **Historical outputs / budgets** | Direct to metrics                              | When detail level doesn't justify a transaction list |

**Exception:** Transactional data can be loaded into a dimension list when that list is useful in the structure; this is rare.

### Data Granularity

Data granularity is critical. When **available data granularity** does not match **planning/input granularity**, the architecture must accommodate through aggregation, allocation, or programmatic generation. If data cannot support requirements, challenge those requirements.

### Design Rules

- **Minimum transformation in Pigment** — Pigment is not an ETL tool; cleaning and transformation should be done outside Pigment before loading.
- **Load only what is required** — Do not add properties or blocks "just in case." Unused data creates bloated, confusing applications.
- **Separate metadata from transactional loading** — Metadata requires codes and verification; it typically comes from a different source than transactional data. Loading metadata from transactional data often yields only names without robust structure.

### Questions to Ask When Information Is Missing

- What are **all data sources** (ERPs, HR, CRM, etc.)?
- At what **granularity** is data available for each dimension?
- At what **granularity** do users need to plan?
- What is the **gap** between available data granularity and planning requirements?
- Where will **data transformation** occur (before or within Pigment)?
- What **metadata** is available for each dimension?
- What **historical data** needs to be loaded, and is it transactional or already aggregated?

---

## Pillar 4: Governance and Security

**Objective:** Determine application structure based on ownership, access, and sensitivity.

For detailed guidance on application structure, hub pattern, and folder organization, see [modeling_principles.md](./modeling_principles.md). For Access Rights design, see `skill:securing-pigment-applications` ([securing_access_rights.md](../securing-pigment-applications/securing_access_rights.md)).

### Key Decisions

- How many **applications** are needed?
- What belongs in the **hub** vs **specific applications**?
- Where do **shared dimensions** reside?

### Application Separation Criteria

| Criterion                                      | Action                                          |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Different teams managing different use cases   | Separate applications                           |
| Sensitive data (e.g. individual employee data) | Independent application (strict access control) |
| Different planning cycles                      | Potentially separate applications               |

### Hub and Dimension Placement

- **Every workspace needs a hub application**, even when starting with a single use case. The hub contains dimensions shared across applications and simplifies adding new connected applications.
- **Dimensions used by multiple applications** -> place in hub, with one exception: when dimension items are **created automatically or manually by end users or business logic within a specific application**, that dimension should reside in that application and be shared outward.
- **Transactional data** typically loads into the application where it is used; if it must be accessed by users across multiple applications, it can be placed in the hub.

### User Experience

- Users cannot natively navigate between applications; **manual links on boards** are required. Architect each application to provide a **complete journey** for a specific user type, minimizing cross-application navigation.

### Common FP&A Pattern

| Application            | Role                                                                                                                             |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Hub**                | Shared dimensions and resources                                                                                                  |
| **Workforce planning** | Independent (sensitive, individual-level data)                                                                                   |
| **Revenue planning**   | Separate (different team/cycle)                                                                                                  |
| **FP&A application**   | Actuals, P&L, plan vs actuals, light planning (e.g. OPEX); pulls planning data from workforce and optionally other planning apps |

### Questions to Ask When Information Is Missing

- Which **teams** will manage which use cases?
- What data is **sensitive** and requires restricted access?
- Do any use cases involve **individual-level** data?
- Which dimensions are **shared** across multiple use cases?
- Are any dimensions **created automatically** by business logic within a specific use case?
- Which **users** need access to which data?
- Do users need to **navigate between applications**?

---

## Pillar 5: Planning Cycle

**Objective:** Design version management and historical plan protection. The planning cycle (version/scenario management) is why customers adopt EPM tools: to plan budgets, reforecasts, and compare against actuals.

For detailed guidance on scenarios vs version dimensions, see `skill:planning-cycles-pigment-applications`.

### Version Dimension

- Create a **version dimension** (e.g. Actuals, Budget, Forecast). It should exist in the structure of **almost every metric** in the application. Critical for FP&A; less so for supply chain or SPM.

### Dual Challenge: Completed Versions

When a planning version is complete:

1. **Numbers must be fixed** as an unchangeable reference.
2. **Numbers must remain available** for reuse in new planning cycles.

### Snapshots vs Live Versions

| Approach          | Use                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Snapshots**     | Fixed copies; numbers never change. Accessed via **data slices**. Reports must use data slices to leverage snapshots. Snapshots cannot serve as the basis for new planning runs. |
| **Live versions** | Maintain a live version of historical plans (alongside snapshots) to enable **replanning from historical data**.                                                                 |

**Constraint:** Avoid too many live versions; **max ~10** recommended (actual limit depends on volume and other factors). Pigment is a live calculation engine.

### Protecting Historical Plans

Build logic so that changes to numbers, formulas, or data do not **retroactively impact** historical plans:

- **Dated loads** — When loading employee rosters or similar data, date the loads so switchover logic prevents new loads from impacting historical budgets.
- **Historical data reloads** — If reloading past-period data that was used to generate historical plans, implement logic to isolate these changes (e.g. effective dating of transactions, copies/imports from transaction lists or metrics).

### Version Initialization

Determine how **new versions** will be initialized:

- Import from another version
- Bulk copy from an existing version
- Clone all data (Clone data 2)
- Re-import from a scenario
- Start from scratch

### Report-Driven Design

- Examine the customer's **final reports**, especially **variations/versions displayed as columns**.
- Determine whether the standard combination of **data slices + calculated items** with versions and snapshots suffices, or if a **custom solution** is required.

### Questions to Ask When Information Is Missing

- What **versions/scenarios** are needed?
- How many **live versions** will exist concurrently (max ~10 recommended)?
- How should **completed plans** be protected from changes?
- Do users need to **replan based on historical budgets**?
- When loading new data, should it **impact historical plans**?
- How will **new planning cycles** be initialized?
- Do **transaction lists** need effective dating?

---

## Validation Before Finalizing

Before locking the architecture, validate:

- [ ] Can the **dimensional structure** support all required inputs and calculations?
- [ ] Does the structure enable the **desired UX**?
- [ ] Does **data granularity** match structural requirements?
- [ ] Are **governance and security** requirements met?
- [ ] Is **version management** adequate for the planning cycle?
- [ ] Are there **fewer than ~10 live versions**?
- [ ] Have **all dimensions** been challenged for necessity?
