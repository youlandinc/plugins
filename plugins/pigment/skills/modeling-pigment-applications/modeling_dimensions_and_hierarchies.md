## Part 1: Dimensional Concepts

### Core Concept: Source vs Target Dimensions

Compare source data dimensions to desired target:

- **Same Dimensions:** No action required
- **More/Different Dimensions:** Map or allocate data
- **Fewer Dimensions:** Sum or remove dimensions

### Dimensional Transformation Cases

**Case 0: No Modification**

- Source and target have identical dimensions
- Example: `Unit Price × Quantity` (both `Product × Warehouse`)

**Case 1: Aggregation**

- Use `BY` modifier with operators (SUM, AVERAGE, MIN, MAX, COUNT)
- Example: `'Order List'.Amount [BY SUM: 'Order List'.Product, 'Order List'.Month]`
- Aggregates from `Order × Product × Customer × Month` to `Product × Month`

**Case 2: Aggregation via Properties**

- Aggregate to parent: `'Inventory Level' [BY SUM: Warehouse.Region, Product, Month]`
- Allocate to children: `'Shipping Rate by Region' [BY: Warehouse.Region] × 'Order Quantity'`
- Note: `BY CONSTANT` distributes single value to multiple items

**Case 3: Add/Remove Dimensions**

- Add: `'Actual Sales' [ADD CONSTANT: Version]` - Copies value across new dimension
- Remove: `'Sales' [REMOVE SUM: Product]` - Aggregates and drops dimension

**Same logical dimension twice (mirror dimension):** When one list must appear twice in a structure (e.g. Months as Time and as Cohort month, Company in rows and columns), use **List Subsets** so a single source list is reused. Subsets behave as separate dimensions and require explicit mapping; see [List Subsets](./modeling_subsets.md) for when to use them and for data-loss and remapping rules.

## Part 2: Building Hierarchies

### Core Concept

Dimension-type properties create hierarchies **without adding dimensions to metric structure**. Creates parent-child relationships enabling aggregation at any level without changing metric dimensions.

**⚠️ Important:** Properties are NOT structural elements of metrics. Only dimension lists (regular dimensions) can be used in a metric's structure. Properties are attributes of dimensions used for grouping, aggregation, and navigation—but they don't define the dimensional grid where data is stored.

### Hierarchy Examples

**Product:** Product → Category → Line

- Product has "Category" property (dimension-type)
- Category has "Line" property (dimension-type)
- Metric: `Product × Month` (not `Product × Category × Line × Month`)

**Organizational:** Employee → Department → Division
**Geographic:** Store → Region → Country

### Property Chaining

**Syntax:** `Dimension.Property.Property.Property...`

**Examples:**

- `Product.Category.Line` - 2 levels up
- `Employee.Department.Division` - 2 levels up

**Formula aggregation:**

```pigment
'Product Revenue' [BY SUM: Product.Category, Month]
'Product Revenue' [BY SUM: Product.Category.Line, Month]
'Sales' [BY SUM: Product.Category, Store.Region, Month]
```

### Benefits

- Report at any level without restructuring
- 5-level hierarchy = 0 added dimensions
- Change hierarchies by updating properties, not formulas

### Mapped Dimensions (Dynamic Relationships)

Also called **time-dependent hierarchy**, **slowly changing hierarchy**, or **slowly moving dimensions**. Parent-child relationships can **change across periods**; past periods keep the old parent, future ones the new. The mapping metric usually varies by **time**, sometimes by **Version**.

**When to Use:**

**Dimension-type properties** for **static** relationships:

- Product → Category (rarely changes)
- Store → Region (fixed)

**Mapped Dimensions** for **dynamic** relationships (most often varying by **Month**; sometimes by **Version**):

- Cost Center → Department (re-org: historical actuals stay under the old department)
- Employee → Team (changes monthly)
- Product → Promotion (varies by period)
- Customer → Segment (behavior-based)

**Implementation (modeler workflow):**

1. **`tool:create_metric`** — mapping metric, Dimension-typed, structured on the **source** dimensions only (e.g. `Cost Center × Month` → Department).
2. Populate values with a **formula** on the mapping metric, or manually via **`tool:set_metric_input`**.
3. **Views** — add a **Mapped Dimension** (Joined Pivot) on the core metric or Table; do **not** add the parent dimension to every underlying metric.

**Example:** Salary (`Employee × Month`) mapped to Team via mapping metric. Employees automatically aggregate to correct Team per month.

**Comparison:**

- **Property**: Static — updating the parent **moves all history** with the child; fine when the relationship never changes
- **Mapped Dimension**: Dynamic — **views only**, varies by period or version; core metrics stay lean

### Ragged/Unbalanced Hierarchies

**Types:**

1. **Variable Depth**: Some paths shorter than others (2 vs 5 levels)
2. **Multiple Parents**: Item belongs to multiple categories (avoid double-counting)
3. **Optional Levels**: Some items have blank intermediate properties

**Recommended Approach: Accept Blanks**

Create full hierarchy, accept blank intermediate levels.

Example:

```
Employee: John → Manager: Jane → Director: Bob → VP: Sarah
Employee: Alice → Manager: [BLANK] → Director: Bob → VP: Sarah
Employee: Charlie → Manager: [BLANK] → Director: [BLANK] → VP: Sarah
```

Formula: `'Salary' [BY SUM: Employee.Manager.Director.VP, Month]`
Result: All roll up correctly despite blanks

**Multiple Parents:**

- **Approach 1 (Recommended)**: One primary parent via property, track others separately
- **Approach 2**: Transaction list for true multi-parent scenarios

### Performance

- 2-3 levels: Excellent
- 4-5 levels: Very good
- 6+ levels: Test with real data

**Workflow:**

1. Identify hierarchy structure
2. Create dimensions top-to-bottom
3. Add properties bottom-to-top
4. Test property chains
5. Create metrics with base dimensions only

## Part 3: Decision Framework - Property vs Dimension in Structure

### The Core Question

Add dimension to metric structure OR reference through property?

**Remember:** Only dimension lists can be added to metric structure. Properties and transaction lists cannot be structural elements.

### Decision Tree

```
Is this dimension needed for...

├─ Direct user input at this level? → YES = Add to structure
├─ Calculations at this specific level? → YES = Add to structure
├─ Filtering that reduces data volume? → YES = Consider structure
├─ Only reporting/grouping? → YES = Use property
└─ Only drill-down/navigation? → YES = Use property
```

### Use Dimension-Type Property When

- **Hierarchy/Grouping Only**: No direct input, only for aggregation
- **Reporting Flexibility**: View data at multiple levels
- **Parent-Child Relationship**: Clear hierarchy, input at child level
- **Many-to-One**: Multiple children to one parent
- **Dimension Explosion Risk**: Already 6+ dimensions
- **Frequently Changing**: Relationships change regularly

### Add to Metric Structure When

- **Direct Input Required**: Users input at this level
- **Calculation Logic**: Formulas need values at this level
- **Significant Filtering**: Dimension scopes most calculations
- **Independent Dimension**: No parent-child relationship (Time, Scenario)
- **Dense Data**: Most combinations have values
- **Allocation Required**: Top-down planning
- **Cross-Dimensional Calculations**: Reference specific items in formulas

### Examples

**Sales with Product/Category:**

- Input at Product level
- Category only for grouping
- **Decision**: Property (`Product × Store × Month`, Product.Category property)

**Headcount Planning:**

- If input/calculation at Department level → Add to structure
- If only employee input → Use property

### Trade-offs

| Aspect          | In Structure | Property   |
| --------------- | ------------ | ---------- |
| **Performance** | Slower       | Faster     |
| **Flexibility** | Fixed        | Dynamic    |
| **Input**       | Direct       | Child only |
| **Maintenance** | Harder       | Easier     |
| **Sparsity**    | Risk         | Better     |

### Best Practices

1. Start minimal: fewest dimensions, properties for hierarchies
2. Test performance with real data
3. Document decisions
4. Review as model evolves

### Common Mistakes

- **Over-Dimensionalizing**: Adding all hierarchy levels (10+ dimensions)
- **Under-Using Properties**: Missing flexible reporting opportunities
- **Inconsistent Patterns**: Properties for some hierarchies, dimensions for similar ones
- **Ignoring Input Patterns**: Wrong granularity level

### When to Reconsider

- Complex formulas working around properties → Add to structure
- Many metrics at different levels → Use properties
- Performance slow with many dimensions → Move to properties
