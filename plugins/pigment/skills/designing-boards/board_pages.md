# Board Page Selectors

Board Pages in the UI are **Board Page Selectors** — default selections applied at the Board level (not View Filters).

## What They Are

Board Page Selectors define the analytical context users expect when opening the Board. **Which widgets actually follow a given Board Page Selector depends on each widget’s View**, not on the Board alone.

### Board-to-Widget Page Compatibility Rule (critical)

A board-level page selector on dimension **D** affects **only** widgets whose underlying View has a **compatible** page on **D**:

- A **simple Page** on D (`dimensionId` = D’s ID), or
- A **Grouping Page** whose `listPropertyPath` resolves to D (see **Board Pages and Grouping Pivots in a View's Pages** below).

To make **one** board-level selector (e.g. Year) drive **multiple** widgets together, **every** target widget’s View must include that same page (or a compatible grouping page on D). If a View has no Year in Pages (e.g. only Version, or no time page at all), the board’s Year selector **does not** filter that widget’s data.

**Workflow implication:** Before relying on Board Pages, **verify or edit each widget View** so Pages align with the dimensions you want at board level. Creating the Board first and only then discovering mismatched Views is a common source of “the board filter does nothing.”

**Key rule (configuration):** Board Page **selectors** come from the union of Pages on the Views you add to the Board. You cannot invent a new Page selector on the Board that no View has. In case of comparison, you **must**  configure **default selected items** for each Board Page at board level (default modalities = compared items). When the user names specific modalities in the prompt - either a single value ("for FY 26") or a subset to compare ("FY 26 and FY 27", "Actuals vs Budget") - those exact modalities are the defaults, single- or multi-select accordingly.

After defaults are set, users can change Board Page selections; widgets whose Views are linked and compatible will update accordingly.

### Unlinking a Page at the Widget Level

Widgets whose Views **do** have a compatible page can still opt out of the Board Page by **Unlinking** that page. For example, if the Board has a Board Page for `Year`, a widget can unlink its `Year` Page so it is no longer driven by the board-level Year selector; that page then behaves as a normal view-level page.

**Note:** “No effect from the board Year selector” is different from unlinking: if the View never had a compatible Year page, the board Year filter **never** applied to that widget—unlinking is not required to explain that behavior.

### Page Selector Visibility

Page selectors can be shown, minimized, or hidden. **Never hide a page selector unless the user explicitly asks for it.**

## Page Selector strategy by Board purpose

| Board Purpose             | Time Page Selector | Version Page Selector   | Scenario Page Selector                   |
| ------------------------- | ------------------ | ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Monthly Review            | Month=Current   | Version=Actuals         | Scenario=Default                         |
| Quarterly Business Review | Quarter=Current | Version=Actuals,Budget  | Scenario=Default                         |
| Annual Planning           | Year=Next       | Version=Budget,Forecast | Scenario=Default                         |
| Variance Analysis         | Month=Current   | Version=Actuals,Budget  | Scenario=Default                         |
| Scenario Planning         | Year=Current    | Version=Forecast        | Scenario=Baseline,Optimistic,Pessimistic |
| Executive Overview        | Quarter=Current | Version=Actuals         | Scenario=Default                         |
| YTD Performance           | Year=Current    | Version=Actuals,Budget  | Scenario=Default                         |
| Year-over-Year / Period Comparison | Year=FY N-1, FY N (multi) | Version=Actuals | Scenario=Default                  |

Adapt based on which Dimensions your Views actually have. Skip any column that doesn't apply. Values like "Current" and "Next" are conceptual — resolve them to actual modality IDs from the Dimension's items.

## Common Filter Dimensions

### 1. Time-Related Dimensions

Choose based on Board purpose. Only if Views have time Dimensions:

- **Single period**: `Month=Jan 24`, `Quarter=Q1 24`, `Year=FY 24`
- **Comparison** (when the user asks to compare specific periods, e.g. "FY 24 vs FY 25", "YoY", "this year vs last year"): multi-select default with exactly those periods, e.g. `Year=FY 24, FY 25`. Use this whenever the same dimension is on a chart axis to span those modalities - the Board Page lets the user change the compared set without editing the View.

### 2. Version Dimension

Only if Views have a Version Dimension:

- **Single version**: `Version=Actuals` or `Version=Budget` or `Version=Forecast`
- **Comparison**: `Version=Actuals,Budget` (for variance analysis)
- **Multi-version**: `Version=Actuals,Budget,Forecast`

### 3. Scenario Dimension

Only if Views have a Scenario Dimension:

- **Single scenario**: `Scenario=Default`
- **Comparison**: `Scenario=Baseline,Optimistic` (for scenario planning)

### 4. Other Dimensions

Any business Dimensions your Views have in Pages: Region, Department, Product Line, etc.

## Examples

### Standard: Quarterly Variance Analysis

```
Board Purpose: Compare actual vs budget performance for Q1 24

Board Pages:
- Time: Quarter=Q1 24
- Version: Actuals,Budget
- Scenario: Default
```

### Edge Case: Views With Only Time Dimensions

```
Board Purpose: Track monthly sales trends

Views have: Month Dimension
Views don't have: Version, Scenario

Board Pages:
- Time: Month=Jan 24 to Dec 24
(No Version or Scenario filters needed)
```

### Edge Case: Views With No Standard Dimensions

```
Board Purpose: Product catalog dashboard

Views have: Product, Category, Region
Views don't have: Time, Version, Scenario

Board Pages:
- Region=All
- Category=All
(Only filter the Dimensions that actually exist)
```

### Edge Case: Mixed Dimension Availability

```
Board Purpose: Mixed KPI dashboard

Some Views have: Year, Version, Scenario
Other Views have: Only Region, Product
Some Views have: No Dimensions at all

Board Pages:
- Year=FY 24
- Version=Actuals
- Scenario=Default

Note: A Board Page only affects widgets whose Views have a compatible
page on that dimension. Widgets whose Views lack Year / Version / Scenario
in Pages are not filtered by those board-level selectors—align Views first
if you need every widget to follow the same board context.

### Board Pages and Grouping Pivots in a View's Pages

A Board Page on Dimension D can drive a View Page if that Page is:

- A **simple Page** on D (`dimensionId` = D's ID), or
- A **Grouping Page** whose `listPropertyPath` resolves to D (e.g., base Dimension Month with property path `["_year"]` leading to Year).

When a Board Page selects a value on the target Dimension (e.g., Year = FY 2024), the Grouping Page filters its base Dimension items (e.g., Months) to only those whose property chain matches the selected value (Months whose `_year` = FY 2024).

**Example: Board Page on Year driving a Month-based Grouping Page**

```
Metric base Dimension: Month
Month has a Dimension Property _year → Year

View Page:
  dimensionId = <Month GUID>
  listPropertyPath = ["_year"]    (Grouping Page targeting Year)

Board Page:
  pageIdentifier: { pageIdentifierType: "Dimension", dimensionId: <Year GUID> }
  defaultModalityReferences: [{ type: "Fixed", fixedValue: <FY-2024-modality-id> }]

Result: Only Months whose _year = FY 2024 are included.
The user sees a Year filter, even though the View is modeled at Month level.
```

**When to use Grouping Pages:**

Use when Views are modeled at a fine grain (Month, Store, Employee) but you want Board-level filters on higher-level Dimensions (Year, Region, Division). This requires clean Dimension Properties defining the hierarchy.

**Important:** The `listPropertyPath` in the Grouping Page must correctly resolve to the same target Dimension as the Board Page's `dimensionId`. Use technical property names, not display names.
