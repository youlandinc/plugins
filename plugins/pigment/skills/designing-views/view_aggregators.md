# View Aggregators and Totals

This guide explains how aggregation works in Pigment Views: where aggregation applies, what creates visible totals, and when to use simple vs advanced aggregation.

---

## 1. Core mental model

Aggregation in a View exists at **two levels**:

1. **Metric default aggregators**
   - Defined on the Metric
   - One for **temporal dimensions**
   - One for **non-temporal dimensions**

2. **View-level overrides**
   - Defined on the View
   - Used either for:
     - **visible pivots** on **Rows / Columns**
     - **hidden dimensions**, including dimensions placed only on **Pages**

### Critical distinction
- **Visible pivot aggregation** controls **subtotals and grand totals** on the grid.
- **Hidden dimensions aggregation** does **not** create new total cells. It only determines how visible cells are computed when some metric dimensions are not on Rows / Columns.

---

## 2. Where aggregation applies

| Dimension placement | Visible on grid? | Pivot aggregation allowed? | Uses hiddenDimensionsAggregations? | Creates visible totals? |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Rows | Yes | Yes | No | Yes |
| Columns | Yes | Yes | No | Yes |
| Pages | No | No | Yes | No |
| Not shown | No | No | Yes | No |

### Practical rule
- If a dimension is on **Rows** or **Columns**, use **pivot aggregation** when you want visible totals.
- If a dimension is only on **Pages** or not shown, use **hiddenDimensionsAggregations**.
- If the Metric defaults are already correct, prefer `Default` / no override.

---

## 3. Totals

### Subtotals
A **subtotal** is an aggregated value for a visible grouped level on a Row or Column pivot.

### Grand totals
A **grand total** is the aggregation across all visible modalities on the relevant axis or axes.

### Important
- **Rows / Columns aggregation** can create visible subtotal and grand total cells.

---

## 4. Metric default aggregators

Every Metric has **two default aggregators**, set together:

- **Temporal default**
  - Common choices:
    - `Sum` for additive flows (`Revenue`)
    - `Last` for snapshots (`Headcount`)

- **Non-temporal default**
  - Common choices:
    - `Sum` for additive measures
    - `Any` / `First` for reference-like values

For rate / percentage / ratio metrics and growth / relative variance metrics, no simple Metric default produces a correct value. These must be aggregated at the View level with **Advanced Aggregators** (Ratio or Growth). See §7 and §10.

### `Default`
At View level, `Default` means: **inherit the Metric's own default aggregator**.

---

## 5. View-level aggregation

### A. Visible pivot aggregation
Use for dimensions on **Rows** or **Columns**.

This controls:
- rollup on the visible axis
- subtotals / grand totals
- aggregation per value field on that pivot

### B. Hidden dimensions aggregation
Use for dimensions:
- only on **Pages**
- or **not shown** in the View

This controls:
- how Pigment collapses dimensions that are not on Rows / Columns
- how visible cells are computed before visible totals are shown

## 6. Simple aggregators: practical reference

### Decimal / Integer
Common:
- `Sum`
- `Avg`
- `Min`
- `Max`
- `First`
- `Last`
- `FirstNonBlank`
- `LastNonBlank`
- `FirstNonZero`
- `LastNonZero`
- `Count`
- `CountAll`
- `CountUnique`
- `CountBlank`
- `Median`
- `Stdevp`
- `Stdevs`
- `Blank`
- `Default`

Typical use:
- `Sum` for additive metrics
- `Last` for snapshots

For rate / percentage / ratio metrics, do not use simple aggregators (`Avg`, `Sum`, ...). Use **Advanced Aggregator Ratio** at the View level - see §7.

### Boolean
Common:
- `Any`
- `All`
- `First`
- `Last`
- `FirstNonBlank`
- `LastNonBlank`
- `Count`
- `CountAll`
- `CountUnique`
- `CountBlank`

### Text
Common:
- `TextList`
- `First`
- `Last`
- `FirstNonBlank`
- `LastNonBlank`
- `Count`
- `CountAll`
- `CountUnique`
- `CountBlank`
- `Blank`
- `Default`

### Date
Common:
- `Min`
- `Max`
- `First`
- `Last`
- `FirstNonBlank`
- `LastNonBlank`
- `Count`
- `CountAll`
- `CountUnique`
- `CountBlank`
- `Blank`
- `Default`

### Dimension / Permission-like / Access-right-like values
Common:
- `First`
- `Last`
- `FirstNonBlank`
- `LastNonBlank`
- `Count`
- `CountAll`
- `CountUnique`
- `CountBlank`
- `Blank`
- `Default`

### Rare / specialized
- `OnlyOneNotNull`
- `BitAnd`

Use only when the business meaning is explicit.

## 7. Recommended patterns

### Additive metrics
Examples:
- Revenue
- Cost
- Units

Recommended:
- Temporal: `Sum`
- Non-temporal: `Sum`

### Snapshot metrics
Examples:
- Headcount
- Ending Inventory
- Balance Sheet values

Recommended:
- Temporal: `Last`
- Non-temporal: often `Sum`, depending on business meaning

### Metrics calculating a Rate / percentage / ratio
Examples:
- Conversion Rate
- Utilization %
- Margin %

Recommended: Advanced Aggregator Ratio

Workflow (Table views):
1. The ratio must exist as a **Metric** with a Pigment formula (for example `GM% = Gross Margin / Revenue`). Do not fake it by adding the same operand Metric twice as separate value fields.
2. Add the ratio Metric and **both** operand Metrics to the **Table**.
3. In the View, include **three** value fields: ratio Metric plus both operands. Configure **Advanced Aggregator Ratio** on the **ratio** Metric’s value field; operands are the two **operand** Metrics’ value fields.

Do not use Advanced Aggregators on a **Calculated Item** value field to stand in for a cross-metric ratio—Calculated Items are for dimension-level derived rows/columns; configure aggregators on **Metric** value fields instead.

Rates and growth-style percentages that roll up across pivots must use Advanced Aggregators wherever the view aggregates.

### Metrics calculating a Growth or a Relative Variance

Examples:
- YoY growth % between 2 metrics
- Actual vs Budget % variance

Recommended: Advanced Aggregator Growth (A-B/B)

### Reference / lookup values
Examples:
- Owner
- Status
- Category

Recommended:
- `First`, `Last`, `Any`, or `Blank`

## 7A. Detecting ratio / variance metrics when adding value fields

**Table views only.** Run this when you add a metric via `tool:update_view_values` (confirm with `tool:get_metric` if unsure).

**Ratio-like?** Name hints (`%`, `rate`, `ratio`, `margin`, `growth`, `variance`, `GM%`, …) or formula divides two metrics (`A / B`, `DIVIDE`) or compares two (`(A - B) / B`). Not supported on Views on Metrics or Lists.

**Operands** — same **A** and **B** as in the formula:

- **Ratio / %** → Advanced Aggregator **`Ratio`**: **A** = numerator, **B** = denominator (e.g. `GM% = Gross Margin / Revenue`).
- **Growth / variance %** → Advanced Aggregator **`Growth`**: **A** = minuend in `(A - B) / B`, **B** = base metric.

Add missing operands to the Table block first.

**Same pass:** (1) `tool:update_view_values` — ratio + both operands as value fields (operands may be `displayed: false`); (2) `tool:update_view_aggregations` (with parameter `type: Advanced`, not Sum) — `pivotAggregations` on the ratio value field for visible Rows/Columns, plus `hiddenDimensionsAggregations` for hidden dimensions. Repeat for **each** Table View that shows the Metric.

---

## 8. Advanced aggregation

Advanced aggregation performs a mathematical operation using **two value fields**.

Examples:
- `Ratio`
- `Product`
- `Sum`
- `Difference`
- `AbsoluteDifference`
- `Growth`
- `AbsoluteGrowth`

### Applicability

| View type | Simple aggregation | Advanced aggregation |
|---|---:|---:|
| View on a Metric | Yes | No |
| View on a Table | Yes | Yes |
| View on a List | Not applicable in the same way | No |

### Constraints
Advanced aggregation:
- is only supported on **Views on Tables**
- requires **exactly 2 operands**
- operands must be **metric value fields**
- operands must be **numeric**
- cannot directly self-reference

### Important
Advanced aggregation is a **View configuration**, not a new Metric.

Advanced Aggregators apply to **Metric** value fields on Table views. They are not the right lever on **Calculated Item** value fields when the goal is a ratio between two Metrics—define a ratio **Metric** with a formula, then set the Advanced Aggregator on **that** value field.

Do **not** duplicate an operand Metric as an extra value field and slap an Advanced Aggregator on the duplicate to imitate a ratio; create the ratio Metric and use its value field as the target.

---

## 9. Mapping to tool fields

### Visible pivot aggregation
Applies to:
- **Rows**
- **Columns**

Configured with:
- `aggregationConfigurations` on the pivot field

Meaning:
- defines how a value field aggregates on that visible pivot
- controls visible totals

### Hidden dimensions aggregation
Applies to:
- dimensions only on **Pages**
- dimensions not shown in the View

Configured with:
- `hiddenDimensionsAggregations`

```
HiddenDimensionsAggregation:
    valueFieldId: <uuid>
    temporalDimensionsAggregator: <aggregation config>
    otherDimensionsAggregator: <aggregation config>
```

Meaning:
- defines aggregation across hidden temporal dimensions
- defines aggregation across hidden non-temporal dimensions
- does not create visible totals

### Default inheritance
Configured with:
- `aggregator: Default`

Meaning:
- use the Metric's own default behavior

---

## 10. Common mistakes

- Trying to use pivot aggregation on **Pages**
  - Page-only dimensions use `hiddenDimensionsAggregations`

- Expecting hidden-dimension aggregation to create subtotal rows
  - It only affects visible cell calculation

- Using `Sum` for snapshot metrics across time
  - Usually `Last` is correct

- Using `Sum` for rates / percentages metrics
  - Use Advanced Aggregator (type Ratio) on all dimensions, with the same numerator and denominator as in the metric formula.

- Using `Sum` for growth / relative variance metrics
  - Use Advanced Aggregator (type Growth A-B/B) on all dimensions, with the same A and B as in the metric formula.

- Using advanced aggregation on a **Metric View**
  - Advanced aggregation is for **Table Views** only

- Using Advanced Aggregators on **Calculated Items** to mimic a ratio between two Metrics
  - Prefer a dedicated ratio **Metric** plus Advanced Aggregators on its value field. Keep Calculated Items for derived **dimension** rows/columns where that pattern fits.

- **Duplicating** the same operand Metric as a second value field to simulate a ratio
  - Does not replace a proper ratio Metric; create the ratio Metric with a Pigment formula and wire operands explicitly.

- Overriding aggregation when Metric defaults are already correct
  - Prefer `Default` / no override unless the View needs different behavior

---

## 11. Quick decision tree

### Step 0
Does the View need a ratio, percentage, or relative variance built from **two** Metrics (same idea as A ÷ B or (A − B) ÷ B)?
- **Yes** → Ensure a dedicated ratio **Metric** with a Pigment formula exists; add it and both operands to the **Table**; then configure Advanced Aggregators on the ratio value field (see §7). Continue to Step 1 for pivot-level aggregation choices.
- **No** → Continue

### Step 1
Is the dimension on **Rows** or **Columns**?
- Yes → use **pivot aggregation** if you want visible totals
- No → continue

### Step 2
Is the dimension only on **Pages**?
- Yes → use **hiddenDimensionsAggregations**
- No → continue

### Step 3
Is the dimension not shown anywhere?
- Yes → use **hiddenDimensionsAggregations**

### Step 4
Are Metric defaults already correct?
- Yes → keep `Default` / no override
- No → define a View-level override

### Step 5
Do you need a math operation between two metrics?
- Yes → use **advanced aggregation** on a **Table View**
- No → use simple aggregation

---

## 12. Summary

- **Metric defaults** are the baseline.
- **Rows / Columns** use pivot aggregation and can create **subtotals / grand totals**.
- **Pages** and other hidden dimensions use **hiddenDimensionsAggregations**.
- **Hidden dimensions aggregation does not create visible totals**.
- **Advanced aggregation** is only for **Table Views** with **two numeric value fields**.
- Safe defaults:
  - `Sum` for additive metrics
  - `Last` for snapshots
  - **Advanced Aggregator Ratio** for rates / percentages / ratios
  - **Advanced Aggregator Growth (A-B/B)** for growth / relative variance
