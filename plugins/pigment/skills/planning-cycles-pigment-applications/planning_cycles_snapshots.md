# Snapshots and Lifecycle in Pigment

A **Snapshot** is a point-in-time copy of an entire Pigment Application. It is the **only** way to freeze state in Pigment because the platform is a live calculation engine. Use Snapshots to close planning cycles, archive past Versions, and keep the live Version count under control.

## 1. When to Snapshot

- **At the end of a planning cycle.** Close the prior Budget Version once the new Budget Version is live.
- **At each cycle for Rolling Forecasting.** Snapshot the Application monthly (or per cycle cadence) so each cycle has a frozen reference.
- **Before a major model change** that may affect prior results.

## 2. Cycle Workflow

For each new planning cycle:

1. **Snapshot the Application** at the end of the previous cycle (or monthly for Rolling Forecasting).
2. **Add a new Version Item** in the Version Dimension. Use **Clone data to** to copy assumptions from the previous Version. Update `Switchover Month` on the new Version.

This pairs naturally with the Version Dimension pattern. See [planning_cycles_versions.md](./planning_cycles_versions.md) for the Version setup.

## 3. Performance Budget

- Target **~6-10 live Versions** in the Version Dimension; review when above 10.
- Archive older Versions via Snapshots; do not leave them as live Items.
- Live Versions inflate recalculation cost.

## 4. Lifecycle Guidance

- **Frozen reference** -> use a Snapshot. Snapshots cannot be edited.
- **Active plan** -> use a live Version in the Version Dimension.
- **Closing a Version** -> Snapshot the App, then optionally remove the Version Item if no longer needed.

## Anti-Patterns

1. **Keeping more than 10 live Versions without review** instead of archiving via Snapshots.
2. **Editing data in a frozen cycle** by re-adding live Versions instead of restoring from a Snapshot.
