# Native Scenarios in Pigment

A **Native Scenario** is an application-level feature (not a Dimension) that creates an independent calculation environment with its own inputs. Use Scenarios for quick "what-if" sensitivity on top of an existing model, or for safe trialing of formula changes via Formula Groups.

For structured planning cycles (Budget, Forecast, Reforecast), do NOT use Native Scenarios. Use a Version Dimension instead, see [planning_cycles_versions.md](./planning_cycles_versions.md).

## 1. When to Use a Native Scenario

Use a Native Scenario only for:

- **Ad-hoc sensitivity analysis** (Optimistic, Pessimistic, Stress test) on top of an existing plan.
- **Trialing a new formula** in a Formula Group before porting it back to the main model.

### Example

- **Simple what-if analysis.** Compare three independent revenue projections (Base, Optimistic, Pessimistic) with their own assumptions and no need to reference each other.

## 2. Constraints

Before proposing a Native Scenario, the agent must know its constraints:

- Independent calculation environment with its own inputs.
- **Cannot reference another Scenario's data** in formulas.
- Lists must be consistent across Scenarios.
- Not a Dimension. Cannot enter a Metric structure or pivot on a Page.
- **Shared vs Local** is set at creation and cannot be reverted. Pick **Shared** if Shared Blocks must carry Scenario-specific assumptions across Applications. Otherwise **Local**.

## 3. Anti-Patterns

1. **Modeling Budget, Actual or Forecast as Native Scenarios.** Use a Version Dimension (see [planning_cycles_versions.md](./planning_cycles_versions.md)).
2. **Treating Shared vs Local Scenarios as switchable.** The choice is irreversible.

## 4. Combining Scenarios with a Version Dimension

Versions and Scenarios are complementary, not alternatives:

- Keep the structured plan in the **Version Dimension** (Budget, Forecast, Reforecast).
- Layer **Native Scenarios** on top for sensitivity or formula trials.
