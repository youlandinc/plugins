# Workforce Planning – Workforce Cards & Mapped Dimensions

## Purpose

This use case describes the **4.0 layer** of a workforce planning application: **Workforce Cards** that provide a **unified view** at Version × Month × **Workforce**, and the **mapped-dimensions** pattern that lets you report by Entity, Department, PnL, etc. **without adding those dimensions to every core metric**. The core model stays on Employee × Month × Version (existing employees) and TBH Requests × Month × Version (to-be-hired); the Workforce layer lifts both into a single dimension and attaches attributes via **card metrics**; reporting then uses **BY: -> Card_Attribute** to project metrics along those attributes when needed.

**When to use this pattern**

- You have **two populations** (e.g. Existing Employees and To-Be-Hired) that must be reported together as one **workforce** (headcount, FTE, comp, events).
- You want **flexible reporting** by Entity, Department, or other axes without hard-coding those dimensions into every stats/comp metric.
- You want to keep **core metrics** on a small set of **driver dimensions** (Employee, TBH Requests, then Workforce) and only “map” to richer dimensions where needed.

**When not to use**

- Single-population models (e.g. only employees, no TBH) may not need a unified Workforce dimension; a single “card” layer per population can suffice.
- If every report always needs the same fixed axes (e.g. always Dept × Entity), you might embed those in the metric structure—at the cost of sparsity and complexity; the mapped pattern is still usually preferable.

---

## 1. Problem in plain terms

- **Core data lives at:** Version × Employee × Month (EE) and Version × TBH Requests × Month (TBH). Adding Entity, Department, PnL, etc. **as structural dimensions** to every metric would create huge sparsity, complex formulas, and heavy access-rights logic.
- **Need:** A single “total workforce” view (headcount, FTE, comp, events) that can be **sliced by Entity, Department, or other axes** on demand, without bloating the core.
- **Design:** Introduce a **Workforce** dimension that unifies Employee and TBH (each Workforce item is either employee-backed or TBH-backed). Build **Workforce Card** metrics (WF_Card_Entity, WF_Card_Department, WF_Card_Currency, …) that hold the **attribute** of each Workforce item for that Version × Month. Keep **stats and comp** at Workforce only. When you need a breakdown, **map** the metric using **BY: -> WF_Card_Department, WF_Card_Entity** (and similar). No extra structural dimensions on the core metric.

## 2. Core concepts (generalized)

| Concept                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Workforce dimension** | A dimension that **unifies** the two populations. Each item is either **employee-backed** (linked via a property to Employee) or **TBH-backed** (linked to TBH Requests). Mapping: Employee → Workforce via e.g. Workforce[BY FIRSTNONBLANK: Workforce.Employee]; TBH Requests → Workforce via Workforce[BY FIRSTNONBLANK: Workforce.TBH].                                                                                                                                |
| **Workforce Cards**     | Metrics at **Version × Month × Workforce** that hold one **attribute** per Workforce item (Entity, Department, Currency, etc.). They are **calculated**: for employee-backed rows, pull from `EE_Card_*` [BY CONSTANT: Workforce.Employee]; for TBH-backed rows, use a TBH-side card (e.g. WF_Card_Entity_TBH from TBH_Stats_FTE or TBH Requests.Entity). So Workforce is “decorated” by attributes without adding Entity/Department as structural dimensions to the app. |
| **Mapped dimensions**   | Reporting axes (Entity, Department, PnL_Account, etc.) that are **not** in the structure of core metrics. You get them by **mapping**: Core_metric [BY: -> WF_Card_Department, WF_Card_Entity]. This **redistributes** the metric along the card values (each Workforce item contributes to the Dept × Entity implied by its cards).                                                                                                                                      |
| **Core stays lean**     | Core stats and comp metrics are defined only at **Workforce** (and Version, Month, Validation Status where relevant). Entity, Department, etc. appear only in **derived** metrics that use BY: -> cards. So the “engine” has minimal dimensions; richness comes at the mapping step.                                                                                                                                                                                      |

## 3. What Workforce Cards do (4.0 layer)

**Role:** For any (Version, Month, Workforce item), answer: “What is this item’s Entity / Department / Currency / …?” so downstream metrics and reports never need to know whether the row is EE or TBH.

**Pattern for a unified attribute (e.g. Entity):**

- **WF_Card_Entity** = IFDEFINED(EE_Card_Entity[BY CONSTANT: Workforce.Employee], EE_Card_Entity[BY CONSTANT: Workforce.Employee], WF_Card_Entity_TBH)
  → If this Workforce row is employee-backed, use EE_Card_Entity; else use the TBH-side entity card.

- **WF_Card_Entity_TBH** = IFDEFINED(TBH_Stats_FTE[REMOVE: Validation Status][BY: TBH Requests.Workforce], TBH Requests.Entity[BY CONSTANT: Workforce.TBH])
  → If there is FTE for this TBH row, use it to carry the mapping; else use the list property TBH Requests.Entity mapped to Workforce via Workforce.TBH.

**Pattern for Department:** Same idea: IFDEFINED(EE_Card_Department[BY CONSTANT: Workforce.Employee], …, IFDEFINED(WF_Stats_FTE[REMOVE: Validation Status], TBH Requests.Department[BY CONSTANT: Workforce.TBH])).

So for **any** Workforce item (employee or TBH), you have a single set of card metrics (Entity, Department, Currency, …) that give its attributes for that Version × Month. All “decoration” is **computed**, not structural.

---

## 4. How this keeps the core on Employee × Month × Version (and TBH × Month × Version)

- **Heavy logic** (events, FTE, compensation) stays where it’s natural:
  - EE: Version × Employee × Month
  - TBH: Version × TBH Requests × Month

- **Lift to Workforce** with simple aggregation:
  - WF_Stats_Headcount = EE_Stats_Headcount[BY: Employee.Workforce][BY: Validation Status."Approved"] + TBH_Stats_Headcount[BY: TBH Requests.Workforce]
  - Same idea for FTE, new hires, terminations, transfers, comp.

- **Do not** add Entity, Department, etc. as structural dimensions to `WF_Stats_*` or `WF_Comp_*`. Instead:
  - Keep them at **Workforce** (plus Version, Month, Validation Status where needed).
  - When you need a breakdown: **Metric at Workforce** then **map via cards**: e.g. WF_Stats_Headcount_Dep_Entity = WF_Stats_Headcount [BY: -> WF_Card_Department, WF_Card_Entity].

So the core engine has only **Employee**, **TBH Requests**, and **Workforce** as the main driver dimensions; all richer axes come from **mapping**.

---

## 5. Mapped dimensions in practice

**Headcount by Dept & Entity**

- WF_Stats_Headcount_Dep_Entity = WF_Stats_Headcount [BY: -> WF_Card_Department, WF_Card_Entity]
  Source: at Workforce. Target: Department × Entity (and remaining dims). Each Workforce item contributes to the (Department, Entity) given by its cards.

**Push to P&L / financial**

- Push_WF_Workforce Plan Data = WF_Comp Plan Data [BY: Workforce -> WF_Card_Entity, WF_Card_Department]
  Compensation at Workforce is mapped to Entity × Department (and then typically to PnL_Account in a later step) via the same card pattern.

**Why not add structural dimensions everywhere**

- If you put Entity × Department (and more) into every stats/comp metric you get: large sparsity, bigger formulas, more complex filters and access rights, and harder refactoring when you add a new axis. With **mapped dimensions**, you only project when needed.

---

## 6. Why unify Employee & TBH into one Workforce dimension

- **Single set of “total” metrics:** One WF_Stats_Headcount (and FTE, new hires, terms, transfers, comp) that already combines EE + TBH. All further analysis (by Dept, Entity, cost, etc.) works on that single number.

- **Consistent events & KPIs:** `WF_Stats_*` metrics map `EE_Stats_*` via Employee.Workforce and add `TBH_Stats_*` via TBH Requests.Workforce. From the reporting layer there is only “workforce events,” not two parallel trees.

- **Unified UX:** Boards can show one grid at Version × Month × Workforce or by mapped dimensions, without separate Employee vs TBH sections.

- **Security & governance:** Security mapping metrics (e.g. `SEC_WF_Card_Entity` = WF*Card_Entity, SEC_WF_Card_Department = WF_Card_Department) let you express access rights once at Workforce level; they apply consistently to EE- and TBH-backed rows and to all `WF_Stats*_`, `WF*Comp*_`, and push metrics that use the cards.

---

## 7. How to apply elsewhere

1. **Define a Workforce dimension** that links to both populations (e.g. Workforce.Employee, Workforce.TBH). Ensure every Employee and every TBH request maps to exactly one Workforce item (BY FIRSTNONBLANK).
2. **Build Workforce Card metrics** at Version × Month × Workforce for every attribute you need for reporting (Entity, Department, Currency, …). Use IFDEFINED(`EE_Card_*`[BY CONSTANT: Workforce.Employee], …, TBH_side_card) so both populations are covered.
3. **Keep core stats and comp at Workforce** (plus Version, Month, Validation). Do not add Entity/Department/etc. to their structure.
4. **Create “breakdown” metrics** only where needed: Core_metric [BY: -> WF_Card_Department, WF_Card_Entity] (and similar for PnL, etc.).
5. **Use the same cards for security** (e.g. SEC_WF_Card_Entity, SEC_WF_Card_Department) so access rights are defined once and apply to all metrics that depend on Workforce.

---

## 8. Pitfalls and reminders

- **Do not add Entity, Department, or other "rich" axes as structural dimensions** to `WF_Stats_*` or `WF_Comp_*`. Use `BY: -> WF_Card_*` for breakdowns; structural dimensions bloat every metric and complicate access rights.
- **Every Employee and TBH Request must map to exactly one Workforce item** (BY FIRSTNONBLANK). Duplicate or missing mappings silently break totals.
- **`WF_Card_*` metrics must cover all Workforce items** (both EE- and TBH-backed). If the TBH-side card is blank for some rows, mapped breakdowns will lose those rows.
- **Security cards (`SEC_WF_Card_*`) must mirror `WF_Card_*`.** If they diverge, access rights will not match the actual data groupings.

## 9. Illustration: Workforce Planning Template

In the Pigment Workforce Planning Template, the 4.0 Total Workforce folder implements this pattern as follows (names are template-specific):

- **Workforce Cards:** WF_Card_Entity, WF_Card_Department, WF_Card_Currency at Version × Month × Workforce. WF_Card_Entity = IFDEFINED(EE_Card_Entity[BY CONSTANT: Workforce.Employee], …, WF_Card_Entity_TBH). WF_Card_Entity_TBH = IFDEFINED(TBH_Stats_FTE[REMOVE: Validation Status][BY: TBH Requests.Workforce], TBH Requests.Entity[BY CONSTANT: Workforce.TBH]).
- **Core stats at Workforce only:** WF_Stats_Headcount, WF_Stats_FTE, WF_Stats_New Hires, WF_Stats_Terminations, WF_Stats_Transfer In/Out. No Entity or Department on these metrics.
- **Mapped breakdowns:** WF_Stats_Headcount_Dep_Entity = WF_Stats_Headcount [BY: -> WF_Card_Department, WF_Card_Entity]. Push_WF_Workforce Plan Data = WF_Comp Plan Data [BY: Workforce -> WF_Card_Entity, WF_Card_Department].
- **Security:** SEC_WF_Card_Entity, SEC_WF_Card_Department mirror the cards for access rights at Workforce level.

When extending or replicating this design, use the **generic concepts and pipeline** above and map them to your own block and dimension names.
