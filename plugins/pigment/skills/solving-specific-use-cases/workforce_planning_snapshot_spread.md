# Workforce Planning – Snapshot Spread Logic

## Purpose

This use case describes how to model the **bridge between snapshot-based source data** (e.g. HRIS loads with a "load month" and sparse events like hire/term) and a **regular planning grid** (e.g. Version × Employee × Month). The "spread logic" layer centralizes snapshot selection, propagation of point-in-time attributes over time, and history-vs-plan behavior so downstream metrics stay simple and maintainable.

**When to use this pattern**

- The source system provides **as-of snapshots** (e.g. one row per employee per "HRIS Load Month" with hire date, term date, entity, etc.).
- Planning or reporting requires a **dense grid** on a regular time dimension (e.g. Month).
- You need a single, consistent rule for "which snapshot applies to each (scenario, entity, period)" and for spreading dates/attributes across periods.

**When not to use**

- **Spreading is optional** if the client can provide **historical data already at the planning grain** (e.g. monthly history). In that case you may not need backward/forward snapshot mapping.
- **Backward spreading is never 100% correct**; it is a best-effort way to **visualize history** using snapshot data. Do not rely on it for audit or legal accuracy.
- **Forward spreading is mandatory** to build a **forecast or plan**: you need a clear rule for which snapshot drives each future month.

## 1. Problem in plain terms

- **Source:** Snapshot data (e.g. HRIS) with a **snapshot date dimension** (e.g. "HRIS Load Month"). Each row is "as of" that date: hire date, term date, entity, department, etc. Data is **sparse** along time (only load months exist).
- **Target:** A **planning grain** (e.g. Version × Employee × Month) where every month needs values for attributes and events (hire date, entity, etc.).
- **Gap:** You must decide, for each (Version, Employee, Month), **which snapshot to use** and **how to propagate** point-in-time values (hire, term) so they appear on every relevant month without duplicating logic in dozens of metrics.

The spread logic layer is the small set of **helper metrics** that answer "which snapshot?" and "what value for this month?" once, so staging and card metrics only reference these helpers.

## 2. Core concepts (generalized)

| Concept                            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Snapshot source**                | The list or metric that holds raw snapshot data (e.g. HRIS load list), with a **snapshot date dimension** (e.g. Load Month) and an **entity mapping** (e.g. Employee Mapping).                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Planning grain**                 | The dimensions you need for planning/reporting (e.g. Version × Employee × Month).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Snapshot selection**             | For each (Version, Entity, Planning Period), **which snapshot date** to use to pull attributes. This is encoded in one or a few metrics (e.g. "effective load month per (Version, Employee, Month)").                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| **Backward propagation (history)** | For **past** periods: "use the snapshot that was actually valid at that time" (e.g. last load month ≤ this month). Used to approximate **historical** view when you only have snapshots.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **Forward propagation (plan)**     | For **plan/future** periods: "use a fixed or forward-carried snapshot" (e.g. latest known load month, or a chosen reference month). **Mandatory** for building a forecast.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **Spread layer**                   | The set of metrics that: (1) define effective snapshot date per (Version, Entity, Planning Period) for history and for plan, (2) spread point-in-time attributes (hire, term, etc.) over the planning time dimension, (3) provide an **active mask** (which (Entity, Period) are in scope, e.g. hired and not terminated), (4) apply **version windows** (only periods inside each version's range). |
| **History vs plan**                | A **global toggle** (e.g. "Populate history?") and optionally a **cutover month per version**. When ON: use backward snapshot selection for historical behavior. When OFF: use forward snapshot selection for a stable plan view. Centralizing this in the spread layer avoids repeating `IF(Populate_History?, ..., ...)` in every staging metric.                                                  |

## 3. Pipeline (generic)

| Layer                           | Role                             | Typical content                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Snapshot load**            | Raw import                       | List/metric with snapshot date dimension and entity mapping; sparse attributes (hire date, term date, entity, department, etc.).                                                 |
| **2. Spread logic**             | Bridge                           | Helpers: effective snapshot date (history + plan), spreaded dates (e.g. FILLFORWARD of hire/term), active mask, plan-month filter; all with version window applied once here.    |
| **3. Data staging**             | Map attributes to planning grain | For each attribute: pull from snapshot source using **BY CONSTANT: [effective snapshot metric]** (history or plan depending on toggle). No repeated FILLFORWARD or window logic. |
| **4. Overrides** (optional)     | User overrides                   | Override staging values where users can edit (e.g. plan overrides).                                                                                                              |
| **5. Cards / final attributes** | Output for reporting             | IFDEFINED(Override, Staging value), still using spread helpers to anchor to the right snapshot.                                                                                  |
| **6. Stats & aggregations**     | Headcount, FTE, events           | Built on top of cards; no direct snapshot logic.                                                                                                                                 |

The **spread layer (2)** is the only place that implements snapshot selection, date spreading, history vs plan, and version windows. All other layers reference its outputs.

## 4. Pattern: two building blocks

### 4.1 Spreading a point-in-time attribute (e.g. hire date)

**Goal:** Have the attribute available for every (Version, Entity, Month) where it is relevant (e.g. every month after hire), not only the exact month it was set.

**Idea:** Use **FILLFORWARD** over the planning time dimension so blanks are filled with the last known value. Then restrict to version window.

**Generic pattern:**

```text
IFBLANK(
  'Source_Attribute',           // from staging or load, already at planning grain where defined
  FILLFORWARD('Source_Attribute', Planning_Time_Dimension)
)
[FILTER: Version.'Window End' >= Planning_Time_Dimension]
```

Result: downstream metrics can reference this "spreaded" metric and always get a value (e.g. hire date) for every month in scope, without re-implementing fill or window logic.

### 4.2 Choosing snapshot for history vs plan

**Goal:** For each (Version, Entity, Planning Period), have one metric that represents "the snapshot date to use": backward for history, forward for plan.

**Idea:** Build two helper metrics: one **backward** (e.g. "last load month ≤ this month"), one **forward** (e.g. "forward-carried load month for plan"). Combine with an **active mask** and a **plan-month filter**. Expose a single "effective snapshot date" used by staging.

**In staging (data) metrics:** Use a single branching point, driven by a global toggle:

```text
IF(
  Populate_History?,   // global toggle
  // History: use backward-propagated snapshot date
  Source_List.'Attribute'
    [BY LASTNONBLANK: Entity_Mapping, Snapshot_Date_Dimension]
    [ADD: Version][FILTER: Is_Actual_Version]
    [BY CONSTANT: 'Spd_Effective_Snapshot_Date_History'],
  // Plan: use forward-propagated snapshot date
  Source_List.'Attribute'
    [BY LASTNONBLANK: Entity_Mapping, Snapshot_Date_Dimension]
    [ADD: Version][FILTER: Is_Actual_Version]
    [BY CONSTANT: 'Spd_Effective_Snapshot_Date_Plan']
)
```

All staging metrics use the same pattern; only the attribute and source change. Snapshot selection and history/plan logic live in the spread layer (`Spd_*` metrics).

### 4.3 Discover blocks and properties in this application

Template names below (e.g. `EE_Load_HRIS`, `Populate_History?`) are **illustrative**. In a real customer app, lists, toggles, and **Scenario** / **Version** properties (such as start and end month for the planning window) have **local names and API paths**. Before implementing the spread layer:

- Use **`tool:search`** to locate the snapshot source list, planning dimensions, and any history/plan toggles; read returned summaries and IDs.
- Search again (with **`kind`** or **`regexp`** if names collide) for **Scenario** (or **Version**) and confirm **which properties** encode the version window—formulas must reference the actual property names in that workspace.
- After building staging metrics, use **`tool:search`** to verify that **reporting or headcount metrics** reference spread-layer metrics only, not the raw snapshot list, if your architecture requires that separation.

Skipping this discovery step often yields a minimal spread layer without version filters, active flags, or downstream metrics that demonstrate the full pattern.

---

## 5. How to apply this elsewhere

1. **Identify** the snapshot source (list or metric), its **snapshot date dimension**, and the **entity mapping** (how to align to your planning entity, e.g. Employee)—using **`tool:search`** as needed so names match the live app.
2. **Define the planning grain** (e.g. Version × Employee × Month) and **version windows** (start/end period per version).
3. **Build spread-layer helpers** in a dedicated folder:
   - Effective snapshot date for **history** (backward) and for **plan** (forward).
   - Spreaded point-in-time attributes (FILLFORWARD + version filter).
   - Active mask (e.g. "entity is active in this period").
   - Plan-month filter to cap the calculation horizon.
4. **Implement staging metrics** that reference these helpers with `[BY CONSTANT: Spd_Effective_Snapshot_...]` and a single `IF(Populate_History?, ...)` branch.
5. **Keep** history vs plan and version windows **only in the spread layer**; do not scatter snapshot selection or window logic in downstream formulas.
6. **Cards and stats** reference staging (and overrides) and spread helpers only; they do not implement snapshot or time propagation.

---

## 6. Pitfalls and reminders

- **Backward spread is approximate:** Good for visualizing history from snapshots; not a guarantee of correctness for audit or legal.
- **Forward spread is required for planning:** Always define a clear rule for which snapshot drives plan/future periods.
- **Do not duplicate logic:** If every staging metric repeats "which snapshot?" and "history vs plan?", changes become risky and hard to maintain. Centralize in the spread layer.
- **Version windows:** Apply "only months in version window" once in the spread layer so downstream metrics do not need to repeat version filters.

## 7. Illustration: Workforce Planning Template

In the Pigment Workforce Planning Template application, this pattern appears as follows (names are template-specific; the logic is the one described above):

- **Snapshot load:** `EE_Load_HRIS` with HRIS Load Month and Employee Mapping; attributes include Hire Date, Term Date, Entity, Department, Job Position, Country, State, etc.
- **Spread logic (folder 1.3):** Metrics such as `EE_Spd_01_Hire Date` (FILLFORWARD of hire date + version window), `EE_Spd_02_Active Employee`, `EE_Spd_03_HRIS Load Month_fwd`, `EE_Spd_04_HRIS Load Month_bwd`, `EE_Spd_99_HRIS Load Month` (effective snapshot month for the view), and `Set_Plan Month View`.
- **History vs plan:** Toggle `Populate_History?` and optional `Populate_History_Month`; staging metrics use `EE_Spd_99_HRIS Load Month` (history) or `EE_Spd_03_HRIS Load Month_fwd` (plan) via `[BY CONSTANT: ...]`.
- **Data staging (1.2):** `EE_Data_*` metrics (Entity, Department, Hire Date, etc.) pull from `EE_Load_HRIS` using the spread helpers and the single history/plan branch.
- **Cards (2.1):** `EE_Card_*` use overrides (`EEO_*`) when defined, else staged data, still anchored via spread helpers.

When extending or replicating this design, use the **generic concepts and pipeline** above and map them to your own block names and dimensions.
