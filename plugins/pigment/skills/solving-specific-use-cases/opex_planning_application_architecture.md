# OPEX Planning – Application Architecture & Patterns

## Purpose

This document is a **reusable blueprint** for an OPEX (operating expense) planning application built around **driver-based forecasting** at a fixed planning grain (e.g. Entity × Department × PnL_Account × Version × Month), with **user overrides** on top of calculated forecasts. It describes the **data foundation** (PULL from Library), **configuration layer**, **forecasting engine** (method per line, SWITCH-based), **output and reporting**, and **naming conventions** so another modeler can replicate the approach.

**What to know when building an OPEX app**

- The logic is usually **simple**: a small set of **predefined forecasting methods** (Prior Year, Last X months average, % of Revenue, $ per Headcount, Manual input) and a **central engine** that computes forecast values per line; then **users can override** those values where needed.
- The main **complexity is dimensionality**: at which level do you plan? Typically **all planning dimensions (Entity, Department, PnL_Account, Version, Month, and often Line) are in the metric structure**, unlike Workforce Planning where many axes are **mapped dimensions** (BY: -> card). In OPEX, you rarely “map” to Entity/Department after the fact; they are structural from the start.

**When to use this blueprint**

- You are building or extending an **OPEX planning** app that:
  - Pulls **actuals and drivers** (P&L actuals, headcount plan, revenue plan) from other apps via **PULL_** metrics.
  - Lets users choose a **forecasting method per line** (per Entity × Department × PnL_Account × Version, with one or more lines per combination).
  - Produces **forecast** then **actual + forecast** and **variance** for reporting and sharing (Push_*).

**When not to use**

- Pure manual OPEX input with no driver-based methods does not need the full forecasting engine (see **OPEX Planning – Forecasting Methods & Engine** for the method layer).
- Apps that get all data from in-app lists (no cross-app PULL) will have a different data foundation but can still reuse the engine and folder patterns.

## 1. Business scope (summary)

- **Planning grain:** Entity × Department × PnL_Account × Version × Month, with a **Line** dimension for multiple forecast lines per combination.
- **Data foundation:** **PULL_** metrics from Library (e.g. PULL_CR_PnL Data Actual, PULL_WF_Headcount Plan Data, PULL_Rev_Revenue Plan Data). No in-app transaction lists for OPEX; actuals and plans come from upstream apps.
- **Configuration:** Version windows (Last Actuals Month, Window Start/End Month); which months are Actual vs Plan (Push_DH_View_Load Actual / Plan); OPEX account scope; default forecasting methods per account; validation and line-prefill options.
- **Forecasting engine:** One **method per line** (Prior Year, Last X months avg, % of Revenue, $ per Headcount, Manual). Central **CALC_Forecast** = SWITCH on method ID → method-specific metric; apply YoY/blank modifier; exclude actual months. **User overrides** on top of calculations (especially for Manual method).
- **Output:** CALC_Forecast per line → OUT_FC (line removed for sharing) → ACT + FC, REP_FC + Last Actual Month, Push_OP_OPEX Plan Data for reporting and cross-app sharing.
- **UX:** Set-up board (config, PULL connection hints); Manager / Controller input boards (method selection, parameters, manual overrides); OPEX Report (actual vs forecast, variance, version comparison).

## 2. Core concepts (generalized)

| Concept | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Planning dimensionality in structure** | Entity, Department, PnL_Account, Version, Month (and Line) are **in the structure** of most OPEX metrics. There is no “Workforce card” style mapping; reporting slices (e.g. by PnL category) use the same dimensions or their parents (BY: PnL_Account.PnL_Account Category). |
| **PULL from Library** | Data foundation = **PULL_** metrics that reference **Push_** metrics from other applications. Set-up board provides formula hints to connect PULL_* to the right Push_* (with REMOVE/FILTER/ADD as needed). |
| **Actual vs Plan windows** | Version properties (Window Start Month, Last Actuals Month, Window End Month) drive **Boolean metrics** (e.g. Push_DH_View_Load Actual, Push_DH_View_Load Plan). All forecast logic **excludes** actual months and **filters** to plan months where relevant. |
| **Method per line** | A **Forecasting Method** dimension (e.g. PY Values, Last X months Avg, % of Revenue, $ per Headcount, Manual Input) with an **ID**. User selects method per line via **INP_Forecasting Method**. Central engine **SWITCH**es on method ID to pick the correct **CALC_*** metric. |
| **Parameters** | **INP_Parameter** (and config **SET_*** metrics) supply method-specific values (X months, %, $/headcount). One parameter metric, populated by IF/SWITCH based on selected method. |
| **Overrides on top** | Calculated forecast is the base; users **override** where needed (especially when method = Manual Input). Override structure is part of the same engine (e.g. CALC_Manual_Input provides writable cells). |
| **Naming conventions** | INP_ (input/driver), CALC_ (intermediate calculation), OUT_ (primary output), PULL_ / Push_ (cross-app), FIL_ (Boolean filters), REP_ (reporting-only), SET_ (settings/config). |

## 3. Pipeline (end-to-end)

```
External apps (Push_*)
  → PULL_* (PnL actuals, headcount plan, revenue plan) + window flags (Push_DH_View_Load Actual/Plan)
  → Configuration (SET_*: scope, default methods, validation options)
  → Line creation (Newline → FIL_NewlineAdded → Line dimension)
  → Inputs per line: INP_Forecasting Method, INP_Parameter, INP_YoY%, INP_Validate, etc.
  → Method-specific CALC_* (CALC_PYValues, CALC_LastXMonthsAVG, CALC_%ofRevenue, CALC_$perHeadcount, CALC_Manual_Input)
  → CALC_Forecast = SWITCH(method ID, …) * YoY/blank modifier [EXCLUDE: Actual months]
  → OUT_FC → REMOVE Line for sharing
  → ACT + FC, REP_FC + Last Actual Month, Push_OP_OPEX Plan Data
  → Boards: Set-up, Manager/Controller Input, OPEX Report
```

See **OPEX Planning – Forecasting Methods & Engine** for method selection, the 5 methods, YoY/blank handling, row lifecycle, and Actual vs Plan window usage.

## 4. Folder structure (generic)

| Folder / area | Role | Typical content |
|---------------|------|------------------|
| **Business Dimensions** | Org axes | Department, Entity, Segment, placeholders. |
| **Chart of Accounts** | P&L (and optionally BS) | PnL_Account, PnL_Account Category, PnL_EBITA, Operator for sign. |
| **Calendar** | Time | Year, Quarter, Month, Month of Year, Quarter of Year. |
| **Actual + Plan View Management** | Version & windows | Version (Last Actuals Month, Window Start/End), Data Type; metrics for Push_DH_View_Load Actual / Plan. |
| **FX Currency Conversion** | Multi-currency | Currency, FX Rate Types, Reporting Currency. |
| **Output** | Primary outputs | OUT_FC, ACT + FC, REP_FC + Last Actual Month, Push_OP_OPEX Plan Data. |
| **Admin / Dimensions** | Technical dims | Line (for OPEX lines), Forecasting Method, Newline (for Add New Combination). |
| **Admin / Library** | Cross-app | Push_OP_OPEX Plan Data, formula hints for connecting PULL_* to upstream Push_*. |
| **Security** | Access | Role, ARM_*, permissions. |
| **Boards** | UX | Set-up, Manager OPEX Input, Controller OPEX Input, OPEX Report. |

## 5. Data foundation

- **No in-app OPEX transaction lists.** Data comes from **PULL_** metrics that reference **Push_** metrics in upstream apps (Hub, Consolidation, etc.).
- **Typical PULL_*:**
  - PULL_CR_PnL Data Actual (Entity × Department × PnL_Account × Version × Month) – P&L actuals.
  - PULL_WF_Headcount Plan Data (Department × Entity × Version × Month) – for $ per Headcount method.
  - PULL_Rev_Revenue Plan Data (Department × Entity × Version × Month) – for % of Revenue method.
- **Window flags:**
  - Push_DH_View_Load Actual: Month in [Window Start Month, Last Actuals Month].
  - Push_DH_View_Load Plan: Month after Last Actuals Month and within Window End Month.
  Forecast engine **excludes** actual months; method metrics **filter** to plan months where needed.

---

## 6. Dimension framework

- **Planning axes:** Department, Entity, PnL_Account, Version, Month. **Line** for multiple forecast lines per (Entity, Department, PnL_Account, Version).
- **Forecasting:** Forecasting Method (ID, Need Input in Parameter?, Parameter Unit). **Newline** (Entity, Department, PnL_Account) for “Add New Combination” → mapped into Line via FIL_NewlineAdded.
- **Version:** Last Actuals Month, Window Start Month, Window End Month, Close Date. Drives actual vs plan and version-specific windows.
- **Time:** Year, Quarter, Month, Month of Year, Quarter of Year (with date properties and hierarchy).
- **Financial:** PnL_Account Category, PnL_EBITA; Operator on category/account for sign. Currency, FX, Reporting Currency.
- **Security:** User, Role.

---

## 7. Metric layers (summary)

- **Input & config:** INP_Forecasting Method, INP_Parameter, INP_YoY%, INP_YoY_Month, INP_Description, INP_Validate; SET_* for defaults and scope; CHK_HasActuals?, SET_Fill_combo_withactuals?, SET_FCMethod_by_PnlAccount.
- **Row control:** FIL_NewlineAdded (Newline → Line), FIL_Rowfilter (visibility: new lines, actual-only, validation gating); CDFM_ID = INP_Forecasting Method.ID for SWITCH.
- **Method-specific CALC_*:** CALC_Actuals, CALC_PYValues, CALC_LastXMonthsAVG, CALC_%ofRevenue, CALC_$perHeadcount, CALC_Manual_Input (dims: Department, PnL_Account, Version, Entity, Month, Line).
- **Engine:** CALC_Forecast = SWITCH(INP_Forecasting Method.ID, 1→PY, 2→LastXAvg, 3→%Rev, 4→$HC, 5→Manual) * CALC_YoY_2_fixblanks [EXCLUDE: Push_DH_View_Load Actual].
- **Output:** OUT_FC; ACT + FC = OUT_FC[REMOVE: Line] + PULL_CR_PnL Data Actual; REP_FC + Last Actual Month (chart continuity); Push_OP_OPEX Plan Data = OUT_FC[REMOVE: Line].

## 8. How to apply this blueprint elsewhere

1. **Define planning grain** (Entity × Department × PnL_Account × Version × Month [+ Line]) and keep **all these dimensions in structure** for core metrics (no “mapped dimensions” pattern like WFP).
2. **Set up PULL_** metrics and window flags; connect to upstream Push_* via Set-up board hints.
3. **Implement the forecasting engine:** Forecasting Method dimension, INP_Forecasting Method, INP_Parameter, one CALC_* per method, CALC_Forecast = SWITCH * modifier [EXCLUDE: Actual]. See **OPEX Planning – Forecasting Methods & Engine**.
4. **Allow overrides** (e.g. CALC_Manual_Input for manual method; same structure as forecast for edits).
5. **Output:** OUT_FC, ACT + FC, REP for reporting, Push_ for sharing; all respect Actual/Plan windows.
6. **Adopt naming:** INP_, CALC_, OUT_, PULL_, Push_, FIL_, REP_, SET_.
