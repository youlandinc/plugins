## Natural Language Recognition

Proactively handle these patterns without requiring explicit commands:

**Create:** "create an assistant", "make an assistant called X", "set up an assistant for my docs"
→ See [references/create.md](references/create.md)

**Upload:** "upload my docs", "add files to my assistant", "index my documentation"
→ See [references/upload.md](references/upload.md)

**Sync:** "sync my docs", "update my assistant", "keep assistant in sync", "refresh from ./docs"
→ See [references/sync.md](references/sync.md)

**Chat:** "ask my assistant about X", "what does my assistant know about X", "chat with X"
→ See [references/chat.md](references/chat.md)

**Context:** "search my assistant for X", "find context about X"
→ See [references/context.md](references/context.md)

**List:** "show my assistants", "what assistants do I have"
→ Run `uv run scripts/list.py`

## Conversation Memory

Track the last assistant used within the conversation:
- When a user creates or first uses an assistant, remember its name
- If user says "my assistant", "it", or "the assistant" → use the last one
- Briefly confirm which assistant you're using: "Asking docs-bot..."
- If ambiguous and multiple exist → use AskUserQuestion to clarify

---

## Multi-Step Requests

Handle chained requests naturally. Example:

> "Create an assistant called docs-bot, upload my ./docs folder, and ask what the main features are"

1. `uv run scripts/create.py --name docs-bot`
2. `uv run scripts/upload.py --assistant docs-bot --source ./docs`
3. `uv run scripts/chat.py --assistant docs-bot --message "what are the main features?"`
